<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> greater part of "Our Journey to the Hebrides"
was published originally in <span class="smcap">Harper's Magazine</span>.
When it appeared it was severely criticised,
and we were taken to task for not discovering in
Scotland and the Scotch what has been made the
fashion to find there&mdash;for not giving second-hand
descriptions, which are the stock in trade of Scotch
guide-books, whether romantic or real; in a word,
for not staying at home and manufacturing our
journey in the British Museum.</p>

<p>It is gradually dawning upon us that this is what
is wanted by the majority of critics. To go to a
country and tell what really happened to you&mdash;to
dare to say, for the information of future cyclers or
travellers, that one small piece of road is bad, that
on one day out of ten or fifteen it rained, that at
one small hotel you were uncomfortable or turned
away, is enough to make the critic declare that
you have found everything in that country to be
awry. This was our fate when we attempted to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>describe the most enjoyable trip we ever made&mdash;our
ride across France. We have no hesitation in saying
that our trip to Scotland was the most miserable.
We undertook to walk, owing to the misrepresentations
of people who we do not believe ever
in their lives walked half as far as we did a year
ago. As we have shown, when tramping became
unendurable we went by coach or train, by steamer
or sail-boat; but we walked far enough to see
the country as, we venture to think, it has seldom
been seen by other travellers. For, with all its drawbacks,
walking has this one advantage: not only do
you stop at the correct show-places on your route,
but you go slowly over the unknown country which
lies between them. That the weather in the Western
Highlands and Islands is vile is a fact which
cannot be denied, though to mention it is held to be
a crime. But, for the benefit of those who, because
we speak of the rain and of the fatigue of walking,
think we shut our eyes to everything else on our
journey, let us say here, once and for all, that we
found the whole country <span class="smcap">BEAUTIFUL</span> and full of the
most <span class="smcap">WONDERFUL EFFECTS</span>; but we must also add
that it is the most abominable to travel through,
and its people are the most down-trodden on God's
earth.</p>

<p>This is the best and most concise description of
the Western Highlands and Islands that could be
given.</p>

<p>Because we saw and described the actual condition
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>of the population, and ignored the pleasures&mdash;in
which we might have joined&mdash;of a handful of landlords
and sportsmen whose fathers brought about
this condition, and who themselves are fighting to
maintain it, we have been asked what is the use of
digging up ancient history? Thank Heaven, it is
now two years since the Crofters' Act was passed by
Parliament; but when we were in the Islands the
first test case of a tenant pleading against the landlord
who wished to evict him was tried, and gained
by the tenant. While we were in Barra, the disenfranchisement
of the entire island was accomplished
by a trick which the most unscrupulous American
politician would not have dared to play. The
Crofters' Commission had then just begun to reduce
rents&mdash;fifty-seven per cent. is the average reduction&mdash;and
to cancel arrears. It has raised rents
on certain estates, is an argument used by landlords,
who forget to tell you that where rents have
been raised they have been compelled to give back
pasture-land to the crofters. It was but a few
weeks after our return to London that a rebellion
broke out in the Island of Lewis, and was quelled
only by the decision of the Edinburgh Court, which
declared deer not to be protected by law; so that for
the rest of the winter crofters and cotters ate venison
with their oatmeal. It was this decision, and
not the war-ships, which prevented open insurrection
in all the Islands.</p>

<p>Some of our critics have been good enough to inform
us that crofters were never turned off their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
crofts to make room for deer. With those who refuse
to accept the testimony officially published in
the Blue-books there is no use to enter into a discussion.
For those who know little of the subject,
and for whom Blue-books would necessitate long
study, here are the facts&mdash;facts which no one can
question&mdash;in a nutshell. We quote from an article
on "The Crofters of the Highlands," published in
the <i>Westminster Review</i> for February, 1888:</p>

<blockquote><p>"In addition to these many injustices" (injustices, that is,
suffered by the crofters), "there is one which in certain districts
almost overshadows them all; namely, the absorption
of vast areas, embracing much fertile land in deer forests. It
matters little whether crofters were actually evicted to make
room for deer, or whether sheep farms have been converted
to this purpose; both have happened very largely, with the
result that, according to the Royal Commissioners, about two
million acres are now devoted to deer forests. Large as this
figure is, it is considerably below the mark, as has been shown
by even better authorities on the subject. Nor must it be
supposed that deer forests consist merely of barren and worthless
land. Unless there is a large amount of good grass-land
in a forest the deer would starve, and all this good land in
times past supported a large population, whose descendants
are now suffering destitution in the bare and unfruitful regions
near the coast."</p></blockquote>

<p>To their shame be it said, the American millionaires
who are beginning to rent these deer forests
are the men who are now doing the most to encourage
the continuance in their present position of the
sons of the land-grabbers, or, we should say, the heroes
of the ancient history and romance of the
country.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span></p>

<p>There is another evil of these great deer forests
which should not be forgotten. A crofter, after
working all day, often has to sit up all night to keep
these beasts, which were supposed to be private property,
out of his little croft. For if the deer eat all
his crops, he had no redress; if the crofter shot
one of them, or hurt it in any way in driving it
out, you may be sure the factor made him suffer
for it&mdash;at one time he would most likely have been
evicted. We want it to be understood that in these
vast tracts of deer forest none but sportsmen and
game-keepers are allowed to go. If your house
were to lie on one side and the village on the other,
you would have to go miles around to reach it.
Nor can you go near streams which run in the
open country, for fear you may disturb the fish,
which are preserved for English or American sportsmen.</p>

<p>Just as we are writing this Preface we have begun
to receive, for the first time in our lives, anonymous
letters. Hitherto we did not believe there
were people stupid and imbecile enough to write
such things. One of these creatures, who is ashamed
of his own identity, encloses, with an amusing letter
written on Kansas City Club paper&mdash;which, however,
does not reveal whether he is the president or
the hall porter of the club&mdash;an article of a column
and a half from the <i>Scotsman</i>, which calls our
"Journey to the Hebrides" "sentimental nonsense,"
"culpable misrepresentation," "amazing imperti<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>nence."
And then, without attempting to show in
what the misrepresentation or nonsense or impertinence
consists, the writer of this article goes on to
give his own ideas on the subject of the crofters,
quoting statements made from other sources, and
attributing them to us, misrepresenting us, and yet
not attempting to contradict any one fact brought
forward in any one of the articles, but taking up
space in the paper to contradict the reports of the
<i>Scotsman's</i> own reporter, printed but a few months
before. We are accused of exaggerating the misery
of the people. We have lying by our side as
we write, column after column, amounting to page
after page, from the <i>Scotsman</i>, which is by no means
the crofters' friend, giving detailed pictures of this
misery, which we, in our generalizing, could not approach.
Here is a specimen taken at hazard from
the pile of clippings. "A Tale of Poverty" it is
headed, and it was published January 17, 1888:</p>

<blockquote><p>"Quite a typical case of poverty was that of Donald Mackenzie,
a middle-aged man, who occupied a half croft at a
rental of £2. He was married, with five young children, and
they had been living exclusively on potatoes, occasionally
with fish, for three months, until they got a half boll of meal
from a destitution fund. That was now done, and he had
that day borrowed a bowlful from a neighbour. He had fished
at Stornoway in the summer, and had kept the family alive;
but his wife assured the stranger that he had not brought
home a single shilling. She added that she herself had not
had shoes for four years, and the children were no better off.
A very similar case was that of Norman Macmillan. He was
a cottar and fisherman, having a half lot from another tenant.
He had also not taken home a shilling from the fishing last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
year; and, except working on his lot, he could find nothing
to do until the fishing season came on again. He had seven
children, the eldest twelve years. They had eaten up their
potatoes by the beginning of winter, and now they had but a
little barley-meal left. He did not know what to do now, he
said, unless Providence opened the way for them. They had
often been without food, he said, although they had kept it.
There was none to relieve them. He stated that formerly
they used to get credit from the merchants while they were
engaged at the fishing, but that they did not get now. One
of the houses visited in this township was that of the wife of
Donald Macmillan, one of the men now standing trial in Edinburgh
on a charge of having taken part in the Park deer
raid. Macmillan lived in a very small cot at the back of his
father's house, which his father had used as a barn. It was
very poorly furnished even for that locality. There was a
family of five small children, and there was only one bed in
the house, with one blanket. Three of the children slept out
with a neighbour. Macmillan cultivated the half of his father's
croft, and had one cow. He was also a fisherman, having
a share in a boat of forty-one feet keel; but, though he
had attended the Barra fishing last summer, he had made
nothing. His wife had got a boll of meal from the destitution
fund, but besides that, she had only two barrels of potatoes.
Previous to getting that meal, they had lived exclusively on
potatoes. She stated that when her husband went out to the
deer raid, there was but one barrel of potatoes; but since then,
she explained, she had fallen back upon the seed."</p></blockquote>

<p>Here is another, from January 20th of the same
year, when four columns were devoted to crofter
affairs:</p>

<blockquote><p>"From here a drive of about four miles brought the visitors
to Arebruich&mdash;a township fixed in a spot which was surely
never intended for human beings. As one passes onwards
from Balallan, the soil gradually sinks lower and lower on
the north side of the loch until, when Arebruich is reached,
it is almost level to the water's edge. The result is that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
land is literally a floating bog, and it is a miracle how the poor
people, who labour away at the barren scraps of earth which
show some signs of cultivation, manage to get any food raised
out of them. A rude, clayish pathway extends for some little
distance from the main road, but it soon stops, as if the
builders had thrown up the work in disgust. There are sixteen
crofts, such as they are, in the township, and these are
occupied by twenty-six families. The first house visited was
that of John Mackinnon, a stout, good-looking man in spite
of his surroundings. He lives on his mother's lot, which is
rented at £2.15<i>s.</i>, exclusive of taxes. His mother, who is
eighty years old, lives, along with an unmarried daughter, in
an adjoining house. He paid 35<i>s.</i> two years ago to the factor,
but since then he has been able to pay nothing. He fished as
a hired man last year at Lybster; but his earnings were so
small that when his season's board was paid he had only 9<i>d.</i>
left. A friend had to lend him his passage-money. At present
he has three barrels of potatoes left, but neither meal nor
money. He has two of a family, besides himself and wife.
They have to live on potatoes. His mother never got any
parochial relief, and she and her daughter have to struggle
along as best they can. He has one cow and eight sheep.
When the destitution meal was being distributed he got three
stones, and his mother an equal quantity. He does not know
what to do, and has no prospects whatever. The next house
presented a worse case. It was that of Widow Murdo Macleod,
a sister of Mackinnon. She said her husband was
drowned at Loch Seaforth seven years ago, when they were
only ten months married. She had one daughter, who was
born shortly after her husband was drowned. She has made
her living all these years by knitting and sewing and odd
jobs, but never got any help from the Parochial Board, though
she applied several times. She has neither land nor stock,
and never had any. She generally gets a few potatoes from
her brother at harvest time. She has half a barrel on hand
at present, and about a stone of meal, the remains of what
was got from the destitution fund. She always tried to be
industrious, and therefore was never actually in absolute
want. She always enjoyed good health, and felt very thankful
for it. The hut in which this woman and her daughter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
live is wretchedly poor, and the single bed is barely covered
with a thin blanket."<a name="FNanchor_A" id="FNanchor_A" href="#Footnote_A" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>On January 20th, in a leader, the same paper
declared that the facts which we have given are
"distressing," and ought to excite "interest" and
sympathy. There is no talk here of sentimental
nonsense! Distressing we should think they were.
One cannot help saying that it is nothing less than
infamous that a mere handful of landlords should
have controlled the destiny of, and extracted every
penny from, the population of these Islands&mdash;the
people whom they have kept for generations in poverty,
not that they might improve the land, but that
they might pass their own time in useless idleness
and cruel sport. It is not a question of over-population.
The real evil is that the Islanders have been
ground down and tyrannized over simply to gratify
the amusements of their masters. We have heard
again and again that the position of a landlord does
not pay; if it did not, the landlords would sell their
estates to-morrow.</p>

<p>For weeks, early in this year (1888), every Scotch
and English paper, even to the <i>Times</i>, had columns
about the misery of the crofters&mdash;that is, columns
of extracts similar to these we have quoted. Whatever
reasons were given for it, no one questioned
their destitution. And yet within a year all these
reports are forgotten; and for generalizing and not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
going into details&mdash;heart-breaking details&mdash;we are
called sickly sentimentalists. So glaring is this
complete forgetfulness and contradiction that we
cannot help taking some notice of it, and calling the
attention of these papers to their own reports.</p>

<p>As to the rest of our critics, they did not even
know enough to contradict themselves, except in
one case, which we have pointed out elsewhere,
and their other criticism is not directed against our
facts.</p>

<p>In dwelling upon the misery of the people, we do
not pretend, as has been suggested, to give an off-hand
settlement of the economic problems of the
Islands. We merely state what we saw, what it
was impossible to avoid seeing, wherever we went.
It must be remembered that it is not merely a minority,
or even a majority, but the entire population
who exist in this condition of absolute wretchedness
and semi-starvation. With the exception of a few
small towns on the coast for the convenience of
tourists and landlords, you find throughout the Islands
but the occasional beautiful castle or shooting-lodge,
or great farm-house, and the many crowded
stone piles politely called cottages. And it was because
we were more struck with this misery than
with the romance of the past that, our journey
over, we interested ourselves in learning something
of the immediate reasons for the present condition
of the Western Highlanders and Islanders, rather
than in reading about the murders and massacres<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
of the MacGregor and the Macleod, the Mac this
and the Mac that. We were not blind to the
beauty, the sternness, the wildness of the country;
but the sadness and sorrows of its people impressed
us even more than the wonder and beauty of their
land.</p>

<h2><a name="IN_THE_HIGHLANDS" id="IN_THE_HIGHLANDS"></a>IN THE HIGHLANDS.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> never looked forward to a pleasure trip
with so much misery as we did to our journey to
the Hebrides. We wanted a holiday.</p>

<p>"Go to Scotland," suggested the editor of <span class="smcap">Harper's</span>.</p>

<p>"Let us rather wander through unexplored
France," we proposed, in a long letter, though we
had already explored it for ourselves more than
once.</p>

<p>"Scotland would be better," was the answer in
a short note.</p>

<p>"But why not let us discover unknown Holland?"
we asked, as if it had not been discovered a
hundred times already.</p>

<p>"Scotland would be better," was still the answer,
and so to Scotland we went.</p>

<p>It was a country about which we cared little, and
knew less. We had heard of Highlands and Lowlands,
of Melrose and Stirling, but for our lives
we could not have pointed them out on the map.
The rest of our knowledge was made up of confused
impressions of Hearts of Mid-Lothian and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
Painters' Camps in the Highlands, Macbeths and
Kidnappers, Skye terriers and Shetland shawls,
blasted heaths and hills of mist, Rob Roys and
Covenanters; and, added to these, positive convictions
of an unbroken Scotch silence and of
endless breakfasts of oatmeal, dinners of haggis,
and suppers of whiskey. Hot whiskey punch is
a good thing in its way, and at times, but not as
a steady diet. Oatmeal we think an abomination.
And as for haggis&mdash;well, we only knew it
as it was once described to us by a poet: the
stomach of some animal filled with all sorts of
unpleasant things and then sewed up. We recalled
the real dinners and friendly peasants of
France and Italy, and hated the very name of
Scotland.</p>

<p>It will easily be understood that we could not
plan a route out of our ignorance and prejudice.
It remained to choose a guide, and our choice, I
hardly know why, fell upon Dr. Johnson. Every
one must remember&mdash;I say this though we did
not even know it until we looked into the matter&mdash;that
Dr. Johnson met Boswell in Edinburgh,
and in his company journeyed up the east coast
as far as Inverness, then across the Highlands to
the west, and so to the Hebrides, coming back by
way of Inverary, Loch Lomond, and Glasgow. It
looked a long journey on the map, and seemed a
weary one in the pages of Boswell and Johnson;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
but as if this were not bad enough, we made up
our minds, for the sake of novelty, to walk.</p>

<p>Of our preparations for the journey I will say
nothing. We carried less than Stanley and more
than the average tramp. We took many things
which we ought not to have taken, and we left behind
many things which we ought to have taken.
But this matters little, since our advice to all about
to start on a walking tour is, <i>Don't</i>.</p>

<p>On the 28th of July we arrived in</p>

<h3>EDINBURGH,</h3>

<p>"a city too well known to admit description."
If Dr. Johnson thought so a hundred years ago,
it is not for us, who propose to be his followers,
to differ from him. Indeed, during our stay in
that city, so eager were we to be faithful to him in
all things that we should have allowed ourselves to
be dined, teaed and suppered, even as he was, but
for an obstacle. The only person whom we knew
in Edinburgh was away, and the fame of our coming
had not, as with Dr. Johnson, gone before us.</p>

<p>We were careful to find St. James's Court,
where Boswell lived, and where clothes, drying in
what sun there is, now hang from his windows.
And we went to the old White Horse Inn, where
the Doctor, on his arrival, stayed until Boswell
came to carry him off in triumph; and where
probably the tourist of another year will not go,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
for already in the court-yard are signs of the coming
of the destroyer.</p>

<p>We had resolved to reverse the order of their
journey by going to the Western Islands first, and
coming home along the east coast. In this way
we should avoid the September storms which kept
them in the Hebrides. Now we also decided to go
straight to Glasgow, and not to stop at Hamilton,
where they spent a night.</p>

<p>On Saturday, July 30th, we began our walk in
a cab, and continued it for many miles in a railway-carriage.
We represented to ourselves that
the country between Edinburgh and Glasgow, of
which we knew nothing, was stupid, and that we
must get to Glasgow for Sunday. There was no
earthly reason for this, but it was an excuse, and
we made the most of it.</p>

<p>Dr. Johnson says that "to describe a city so
much frequented as</p>

<h3>GLASGOW</h3>

<p>is unnecessary," and again we are willing to take
his word for it. But its Cathedral was the first
of the many surprises Scotland had in store for us.
We had heard of it, but that was all. One young
lady of Glasgow, fresh from a tour on the Continent,
told us that she had never seen it. We
were therefore prepared to find it no great thing.
The exterior did not disappoint our expectations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
but we have seldom been more impressed with an
interior, and this though we had just come from
the loveliest churches of England.</p>

<p>The crypt, or rather the under church, is its
pride, as indeed it well may be. A verger stood
smoking a pipe at the south door, and we told
him what we thought. J&mdash;&mdash;, after three years'
work in the English cathedrals, felt himself no
mean authority.</p>

<p>"It's the finest in the world," said the verger.</p>

<p>"In Great Britain perhaps, but not in Europe,"
said J&mdash;&mdash;; for we had been but a moment before
comparing it, as it now is, a cold, bare, show-place,
to the under church of Assisi with the frescos
on the walls, the old lamps burning before
altars, the sweet smell of incense, and the monks
kneeling in prayer.</p>

<p>"I only tell you what those <i>qualified</i> have said,"
and the verger settled the matter and J&mdash;&mdash;'s pretensions.</p>

<p>It was in the Glasgow crypt Rob Roy gave the
warning to Frank Osbaldistone. The guide-book
recalled the incident, which we had forgotten. Indeed
the farther we went, the more we were reminded
that to travel in Scotland is to travel
through the Waverley Novels, and that these to
us were but a name. Since our return we have
tried to read them again, to be quite honest, with
but indifferent pleasure. We are so wanting in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
appreciation that we find Scott's description of
the crypt stupid, and we are not thrilled by the
daring deeds of the MacGregor.</p>

<p>The Art Gallery in Glasgow was no less a surprise
to us than the Cathedral. Its catalogue contains
more Titians, Rembrandts. Hobbemas, and
other great masters than any other in Europe.
But if we wondered at the catalogue, we were still
more astonished when we came to see the pictures!</p>

<p>We stayed in Glasgow until Monday morning,
when we again took the train, but this time for a
few miles only. We bought tickets for Kilpatrick,
and a sharp lookout we had to keep for it from the
carriage windows. At the stations, no one called
the names, which, in true British fashion, were less
easy to find than that of the best brand of mustard
or of the best hotel in Glasgow. At Kilpatrick,
when I pulled my head in after the usual
search, J&mdash;&mdash; was already at the opposite door.
He did not care where he was, he said; he would
get out. In the distance, we could see Dumbarton
Rock rising from the plain against a blue sky.
Here, as in our plans for the day's journey, it was
the one prominent landmark.</p>

<p>Kilpatrick is said to have been the birthplace of
St. Patrick. I do not know what authority Black<a name="FNanchor_C" id="FNanchor_C" href="#Footnote_C" class="fnanchor">[C]</a>
has for the legend; certainly not that of the vil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>lagers.
St. Patrick was no British man, one of
them told us; and, moreover, he never lived in
Kilpatrick, but on the hill. But had we ever
heard of Captain Shonstone, the hairbor-maister?
He was a great man.</p>

<p>We made a great show of briskness by going
the long way round by the canal. This was the
only time throughout our journey that we turned
from the main road&mdash;except to take a short-cut.
Mr. Lee Meriwether, in his Tramp Abroad, thought
it an advantage of walking that he could leave the
road to see whatever was to be seen near, but not
from it. For our part, after the first mile, we
never took an extra step for any sight; that is,
whenever our knapsacks were on our backs. At
Dumbarton we did not even climb the rock, though
Dr. Johnson walked to the very top. Instead, we
lunched and talked politics with the British workman
in a coffee tavern.</p>

<p>After Dumbarton, we left the Clyde to follow
the Leven. It was just beyond the town we first
saw Ben-Lomond, a blue shadow on the horizon
when the clouds were heavy above; a high bare
mountain, seamed and riven, when the sun shone
upon it. We lost sight of it in a succession of
long, stupid villages; on the shady road, where the
trees met overhead, we could see it again through
the net-work of branches. Clouds were low on its
heights, and a veil of soft light rain fell before it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
when, having left our knapsacks in the inn at Balloch,
we rowed up the Leven, a little quiet river
between low woods and flat meadow-land, to</p>


<h3>LOCH LOMOND.</h3>

<p>It was the first Scotch lake we saw, and we thought
it very like any other lake.</p>

<p>We were off by eight in the morning. It was
clear and cool, like an October day at home. Our
road lay for a while close to the loch, then turned
and went round the parks and lawns that sloped
gently to the shore, so that it was only over a stone
wall or through a gap in the hedge we could see
the blue water and the wooded islands. We were
now on the fighting-ground of the Colquhoun and
the MacGregor, we learned from Black, who&mdash;we
know it to our cost&mdash;is a better guide to the romance
and history of Scotland than to its roads.
It is but poor comfort when you ask for a good
route to be given a quotation.</p>

<p>Rob Roy is the hero of Loch Lomond, and if
you cross&mdash;as we did not&mdash;to the other side, you
may see his cave and his prison and a lot of his
other belongings. But I think that which is best
worth seeing on the loch is the Colquhoun's village
of Luss, with its neat, substantial cottages and
trim gardens. In the Highlands you can have
your fill of tales of outlaws and massacres and
horrors; but it is not every day you come to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
village like this, where men are allowed to live a
little better than their beasts.</p>

<div class="figcenter"> <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
<a name="TARBET_LOCH_LOMOND" id="TARBET_LOCH_LOMOND"></a>
<a href="images/illus031a.jpg"><img src="images/illus031.jpg" width="597" height="323" alt="TARBET, LOCH LOMOND." title="" />
</a></div>
<p class="caption">TARBET, LOCH LOMOND.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>
<p>At the Colquhoun Arms in Luss we ate our

lunch, and that was our undoing. It left us in a
mood for lounging, and we had still eight miles to
go. We found it harder work the second day
than the first. Our knapsacks weighed like lead,
and did not grow lighter; each mile seemed interminable.
This was the more provoking because
with every step the way grew lovelier. Almost
all the afternoon we were within sight of the
loch, while on our left the mountains now rose
from the very road-side, and hedges gave place to
hill-sides of ferns and heather-patched bowlders.
Used as we both were to cycling, the slowness and
monotony of our pace was intolerable. We longed
for a machine that would carry us and our knapsacks
with ease over the hard, dustless road. For
one mile we tried to keep each other in countenance.
J&mdash;&mdash; was the first to rebel openly. The
Highlands were a fraud, he declared; the knapsack
was an infernal nuisance and he was a fool to
carry it. About three miles from Tarbet he sat
down and refused to go any farther.</p>

<p>Just then, by chance, there came a drag full of
young girls, and when they saw us they laughed,
and passed by on the other side. And likewise a
dog-cart, and the man driving, when he first saw
us, waved his hand, taking us to be friends; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
when he was at the place and looked at us, he also
passed by on the other side. But two tricyclers,
as they journeyed, came where we were; and
when they saw us they had compassion on us,
and came to us, and gathered up our knapsacks
and set them on their machines and brought them
to the inn and took care of them. And yet there
are many who think cyclers nothing but cads on
casters!</p>

<p>To tell the truth, had these two men been
modern Rob Roys, we would have yielded up our
knapsacks as cheerfully; nor would we have sorrowed
never to see them again.</p>

<p>As we went on our way lightly and even gayly,
we came to the inn at</p>


<h3>TARBET,</h3>

<p>and were received by a waiter in a dress-coat. It
was a big hotel low down by the loch, with Ben-Lomond
for opposite neighbor. The company at
dinner was made up of Englishmen and Englishwomen.
But everybody talked to everybody else.
An Englishman, it seems, becomes civilized in the
Highlands. There, those he sits down with at
dinner, as is the way with Frenchmen, are his
friends; at home, he would look upon them as his
enemies.</p>

<p>After dinner we went to walk with the cyclers.
As a great theatrical moon came sailing up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
through the sky behind Ben-Lomond, one told us
in broad Scotch how from the Jungfrau he had
once watched the moon rise, and at the sight had
bur-r-r-st into tee-eers. But just then, had I wept
at all, it must have been from sheer weariness, so
I turned my back upon the beauty of the evening
and went to bed.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
<a name="GLENCROE" id="GLENCROE"></a>
<a href="images/illus035a.jpg"><img src="images/illus035.jpg" width="606" height="396" alt="GLENCROE." title="" />
</a></div>
<p class="caption">GLENCROE.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>
<p>It was well on towards noon the next day before
we were on our way.</p>

<p>"It looks like business," said a young lady
feeding a pet donkey, as she saw us start.</p>

<p>"It feels like it too," said I, dolefully, for the
knapsacks were no lighter, and our feet were
tender after the sixteen miles of the day before.</p>

<p>It was two easy miles to Arrochar, a village of
white cottages and a couple of inns, one with a
tap, the other with a temperance sign. Here we
were ferried across Loch Long by a fisherman sad
as his native hills. It was a wretched season, he
told us; there were few people about. On the
west side of the loch, the road was wild, and soon
turned up to Glencroe. At the lower end of the
pass, sheep browsed on the hill-sides, and in tiny
fields men and women were cutting grass. The
few cottages were new. But these things we left
behind when the road began to wind upward in
short, sudden curves. It was shut in on both sides
by mountains; the sun glittered on their sheer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
precipices and overhanging cliffs and on the hundreds
of watercourses with which their slopes
were seamed. The way was steep, and I thought
I should have died before I reached the top. At
the last we made a short-cut up to the stone
known, out of compliment to Wordsworth, as
"Rest and be Thankful." There may be men
and women with so much poetry in their souls,
that after that stiff climb they will still care to find
the appropriate lines in their guide-books, and
then have breath enough left to repeat them.
But we were too hot and tired to do anything but
lie on the grass and, as we rested, look down upon
and enjoy the wonderful pictures away beyond and
below us.</p>

<p>In this lonely place a little loch lies dark and
peaceful among the hills. Restil, its name is;
I do not know what it means, but it has a pretty
sound. Nothing could be more monotonous to
tramp over than the long stretch of road which
follows Kinglas Water almost to the shores of
Loch Fyne. Our feet were blistered, and now
ached at every step. Our shoulders were sorely
strained. The things we said are best not written.
When the coach from Inverary passed and
until it was out of sight, we made a feint of not
being tired. But the rest of the way we now
grew eloquent in abuse, now limped in gloomy
silence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a mistake (which we afterward regretted)
going to</p>


<h3>CAIRNDOW,</h3>

<p>and I do not know why we made it, except that
in mapping out our route we had little help from
Black. We had to learn from experience, which
is but a poor way, if you find out your errors
when it is too late to mend them. We were bound
to Inverary, Dr. Johnson's next stopping-place.
At the top of Glencroe, we should have turned to
our left and walked down Hell's Glen to St. Catharine's,
where there is a steam ferry to Inverary
on the opposite shores of Loch Fyne. As it was,
we had turned to our right and walked to a point
almost at the top of the loch where there was no
ferry, and where five miles lay between us and St.
Catharine's. This was the coach road from Tarbet,
and the guide-book has but little interest in
travellers who go afoot. Though one hears much
of walking tours in the Highlands, but few are
made. In seven weeks' walking we scarcely met
even a tramp.</p>

<p>We felt our mistake the more keenly because of
the unpleasantness of the inn. The landlady greeted
us warmly; like the ferry-man of the morning,
she found there were too few tourists abroad.
But her greeting was better than her rooms or her
dinner, and she herself was unco' canny.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>There was in the inn a young artist whose name
she told us. We had never heard it, and this
showed our ignorance; for he came from London,
where he had won the first prize in an exhibition,
and his wife, who was with him, had won the second,
and altogether they were very great, and it
was small wonder they did not care to dine with
unknown travellers who carried sketch-books.
But, indeed, I think in no country in the world except
Great Britain will one artist not be glad to
meet another when chance throws them together.
An English artist wrecked on a desert island
would not recognize a brother artist in the same
plight as "one of the fraternity," unless the latter
could make good his claims by the excellence, not
of his work, but of his letters of introduction or
the initials after his name. Nor does he unbend
in the Highlands, where Englishmen of other
crafts become so very sociable.</p>

<p>When we walked out after a bad dinner, the
eastern hills rose against the pale yellow light of
the coming moon. One star sent a shining track
across the dark water, over which every now and
again the wind marked its passage in long lines
of silver ripples. Of all the sweet still evenings
of our journey, we shall always remember this as
the sweetest and stillest.</p>

<p>It was in the morning that the landlady showed
her canniness. She sent us off in her boat to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
rowed across the loch; this, she said, we should
find the shorter way to Inverary. But on the
water one of the boys let slip the truth. We
should have half the distance to walk if we went
straight from Cairndow to St. Catharine's, there
to cross by the steam ferry. Judge of our righteous
wrath! When they rowed us back to the
Cairndow side, the boys were careful to land us a
good quarter of a mile below the inn. The worst
of it was that once on shore again, we did not
know whom to believe, the mother or the children.
We were in a fine state of doubt, until a woman
in the first cottage we came to reassured us. This
was by far the shorter way, and we need not hurry,
she added; we could not help reaching St. Catharine's
in time for the ferry at eleven.</p>

<p class="caption">INVERARY.</p>

<p>She was right. It seemed a short walk by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
loch. We stopped only once, that J&mdash;&mdash; might get
an old ruin on the very water's edge. When we
came to St. Catharine's we had an hour or more to
sit at the inn door. It was one of those hot, misty
days, which are not rare during the short Highland
summer. The mountains were shrouded in
a burning white haze. The loch was like glass.
On its opposite shore, Inverary, white and shining,
was reflected in its waters; and close by, at the
foot of the hills, the turreted castle of the Argylls
stood out strongly against the dark wood.</p>

<p>Here we made up our minds to go to Dalmally
by coach. It was much too hot to walk. This
left us free to take a nearer look at the castle,
which, when we saw how painfully it had been
restored, we thought less fine. In the town itself,
though there is plenty sketchable, there is nothing
notable, save the old town-cross, with its
weather-worn carvings, which stands upon the
shore, with loch and hills for background.</p>

<p>After lunch at the Argyll Arms, suddenly an
excursion steamer and the coach from Tarbet
poured streams of tourists into the place. Two
more coaches dashed out from the hotel stables.
The wide street was one mass of excursionists<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
and landlords and waiters, and coachmen in red
coats and gray beavers, and guards with bundles
and boxes. There was a short, sharp struggle for
seats, and in the confusion we came off with the
best, and found ourselves on the leading coach,
whirling from the glare of the loch, through the
cool shade of a wooded glen, to the stirring sounds
of the "Standards on the Braes of Mar," shouted
by a party of Lowland Sandies who filled the other
seats.</p>

<p>At the first pause, the coachman pointed to
deer standing quietly under the graceful silver
birches that shut in the road.</p>

<p>"Shush-sh-sh-sh!" screamed the Sandies, in a
new chorus.</p>

<p>"Why canna ye put salt on their tails?" cried
one.</p>

<p>Though later, cows and sheep and ducks fled
before their noise, the deer never stirred. And
yet, I suppose, in the season the Duke of Argyll
and his guests come stalking these tame creatures,
and call it sport.<a name="FNanchor_D" id="FNanchor_D"></a><a href="#Footnote_D" class="fnanchor">[D]</a></p>

<p>All that afternoon, through the woods of Glenaray
and across the purple moorland beyond, afar
over the banks and braes and streams around, there
rang out the strong voice of Sandy off for a holiday.
Highland valleys were filled with the pathetic
strains of</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"We started up a candy shop, John,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But couldna make it pay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">John Anderson, my jo!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Highland hills re-echoed the burden of a loving
father's song:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"For she's my only daughter,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">'Tis I myself that taught her<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To wear spangled clothes<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And twirl round on her toes,<br /></span>
<span class="im1">And her name it was Julia McNaughter."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Between songs there were jokes, as at the minstrels.</p>

<p>"Ta-ta, James; au revore," they called to men
mowing in the meadows.</p>

<p>"And havna ye a letter for us?" they asked the
old woman at a lonely post-office.</p>

<p>To a beggar by the way-side they gave witticisms
with their pennies:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Canna ye sing a Gaelic song?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Canna ye stand on your head?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"He's a Grecian!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p><p>If the point of their jokes is not very clear, the
fault is not mine; I am trying to be not witty, but
realistic.</p>

<p>There was one in the party&mdash;a woman, of
course&mdash;who remembered duty.</p>

<p>"Isn't it bonny country?" she kept asking.
"And what's yon bonny glen, my laddie?" and
she poked the guard.</p>

<p>"And Sandy, mon, ye're nae lookin' at the scenery,"
she said to her husband.</p>

<p>"Toot, I clean forgot the scenery," and Sandy
broke off in his singing to stare through his field-glass
at a bare hill-side.</p>

<p>Almost within sight of Loch Awe we came to
a hill that was so steep we all left the coach and
walked a couple of miles up the shadeless hot
road. An objection sometimes made to cycling
is that it is half walking; but in the Highlands
you would walk less if you rode a cycle than if
you travelled by coach. From the top of the hill
we looked down to where, far below, lay Loch
Awe and its many islands. In this high place,
with the beautiful broad outlook, gypsies had
camped. I never yet knew the Romany who
did not pitch his tent in the loveliest spot for
miles around.</p>

<p>We had no definite plan for the night. We
left it to chance, and we could not have done
better. At the station at Dalmally we said good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>by
to our friends, who went gayly to another bonny
glen, and we took the train for Loch Awe. It
hurried us round the top of the loch in a few minutes
to Loch Awe station, where on the platform
were crowds of men in conventional tweed knickerbockers
and Norfolk jackets, and women in jockey
caps and fore-and-afts; and moreover, there were
pipers with their pipes under their arms. From the
carriage window we had seen the Loch Awe hotel,
perched high on the hill-side, and looking down to
the gray ivy-grown ruins of Kilchurn. It seemed
no place for tourists who carried their baggage on
their backs. But hardly had we left the carriage,
when up stepped an immaculate creature in blue
coat and brass buttons to tell us, with his cap in his
hand, that our telegram had been received and the
Port Sonachan boat was in waiting. That from
all that elegant crowd of travellers he should have
picked us out, the only two in the least disreputable-looking
and travel-worn, showed, we thought,
his uncommon discrimination. If, without knowing
it, we had telegraphed to a hotel of which
we had never heard, if in consequence a private
steam-yacht was now at our disposal, why should
we hesitate? Indeed, we had not time, for immediately
a sailor seized our shabby knapsacks and carried
them off with as much respect as if they had
been Saratoga trunks. We followed him into a
little yacht, which we graciously shared with an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
Englishman, his wife, two children, eleven bags,
and three bath-tubs.</p>

</a></div>
<p class="caption">CROSS AT INVERARY.</p>

<p>The man in the blue coat kindly kept his boat at
the pier until J&mdash;&mdash; had made quite a decent note
of Kilchurn Castle. It has its legends, but it is
not for me to tell them. Mr. Hamerton, who has
written poetry about it and ought to know, declares
they are not to be told in prose. Then we
steamed down the loch, past the islands, one with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
a lonely graveyard, another with a large house;
past the high mountains shutting in the Pass of
Brander, to a hotel perfect of its kind. It stood
on a little promontory of its own. A bay-window
in the dining-room commanded the view north,
south, and west over the loch. As we ate our
dinner we could watch the light slowly fade
and the hills darken against it. The dinner was
excellent, and the people at table were friendly.
There was a freedom about the house that made
us think of Dingman's Ferry in its best days, of
the Water Gap before its splendor came upon it,
of Bar Harbor before it was exploited. It was
not a mere place of passage, like the hotels at
Tarbet and at Loch Awe; but those who came to
it stayed for their holiday. All the men were
there for the fishing, which is good, and most of
them, tired after their day's work, came to dinner
in their fishing clothes. Their common sport
made them sociable. They were kind to us, but
in their kindness was pity that we too were not
fishermen. The landlord, who was a Cameron,
was neither great nor obsequious. He had interest
for this man's salmon and that man's trout,
and good counsel for our journeying. He had
been game-keeper for many years on the shores
of Loch Awe, which he knew and loved. He
had seen Mr. Hamerton, and his boats and his
painter's camp. Since we have been to Loch Awe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
we have had an admiration for Mr. Hamerton
which his book about it never gave us. Seldom
do men show greater love for beauty in their
choice of a home than he did, when he set up his
tent on the island of the dead. As his books
show, he is sufficient unto himself. Before the
first month had ended, many might have wearied
for other company save that of the hills and the
water, the dead and a madman.</p>

<p>We left Port Sonachan in the morning. Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
Cameron walked down to his pier with us, and a
Duncan rowed us across to South Port Sonachan,
where there is another hotel, and where we took
the road to Loch Etive. Again the morning was
hot and misty. In the few fields by the way
men and women were getting in the hay, and the
women, in their white sacks and handkerchiefs
about their heads, looked not unlike French peasants.
On each hill-top was a group of Highland
cattle, beautiful black and tawny creatures, standing
and lying in full relief against the sky. Two
miles, a little more or less, brought us to a village
wandering up and down a weed-grown, stone-covered
hill-side. To our left a by-road climbed to
the top of the hill, past the plain, bare kirk, with
its little graveyard, and higher still to two white
cottages, their thatched roofs green with a thick
growth of grass, and vines growing about their
doors, the loch and the mountain in the background.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>But the cottages, which to the right of our road
straggled down to a rocky stream below, had no
redeeming whitewash, no vines about their doors.
The turf around them was worn away. Some
were chimneyless; on others the thatch, where
the weeds did not hold it together, had broken
through, leaving great holes in the roof. On a
bench, tilted up against the wall of the lowest of
these cottages, sat an old gray-haired man in Tam
o' Shanter, his head bent low, his clasped hands
falling between his knees. It was a picturesque
place, and we camped out a while under an old
cart near the road-side. Perhaps it would have
been wise if, like Mr. Hamerton, we could have
seen only the picturesqueness of the Highland
clachan, only the color and sublimity of the huts,
only the fine women who live within them. But
how could we sit there and not see that the picturesqueness
was that of misery, that whatever
color and sublimity there might be&mdash;and to the
sublimity, I must confess, we were blind&mdash;were
but outward signs of poverty and squalor, and
that the huts sheltered not only strong young
women, but feeble old men like that pathetic figure
with the clasped hands and bent head? We
have seen the old age of the poor, when we thought
it but a peaceful rest after the work of years. In
English almshouses we have found it in our hearts
to envy the old men and women their homes; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
here despair and sadness seemed the portion of
old age. I do not know why it was, but as we
watched that gray-haired man, though there was
a space of blue sky just above him, and the day
was warm and the air sweet, it was of the winter
he made us think; of the time soon to come when
the cold winds would roar through the pass, and
snow would lie on the hills, and he would shiver
alone in the chimneyless cottage with its one tiny
window. A few miles away, men in a fortnight
throw away on their fishing more than these people
can make in years. Scotch landlords rent
their wild, uncultivated acres for fabulous sums,
while villages like this grow desolate. If, when
you are in the Highlands, you would still see them
as they are in the stupid romance of Scott or in
the sickly sentiment of Landseer, or as a mere
pleasure-ground for tourists and sportsmen, you
must get the people out of your mind, just as the
laird gets them off his estate. Go everywhere,
by stage and steamboat, and when you come to a
clachan or to a lonely cottage, shut your eyes and
pass on; else you must realize, as we did&mdash;and
more strongly as we went farther&mdash;that this land,
which holiday-makers have come to look upon as
their own, is the saddest on God's earth.</p>

<p>Before we left the shade of the cart a little girl
went by, and we asked her the name of the village.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>"Kilchrennan," she said, with impossible gutturals,
and then she spelled it for us.</p>

<p>It was a good sign, we thought; if Highland
children to-day are taught to spell, Highland men
and women to-morrow may learn to think, and
when they learn to think, then, let the landlord
remember, they will begin to act.</p>

<p>After Kilchrennan, the road crossed the moorland,
Ben-Cruachan towering far to our right. At
the foot of the one wooded hill-side in all this heather-clad
moor we met with the only adventure of
the morning; for it was here we espied in the road,
in front of us, a black bull. It fixed its horrid
eyes upon us; its horns seemed to stretch from
one side of the way to the other. We cast in our
minds whether to go forward or through the wood,
but we thought it best to get the trees between
us, and we fled up the mountain and never stopped
until we had left it a goodly space behind; for
indeed it was the dreadfullest bull that ever we
saw.</p>

<p>We came to another wretched village down by
Loch Etive. Here again in the sunshine was an
old man. He was walking slowly and feebly up
and down, and there was in his face a look as
if hope had long gone from him. In England,
scarce a town or village is without its charities;
but in the Highlands, while deer and grouse are
protected by law, men are chased from their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
homes,<a name="FNanchor_E" id="FNanchor_E" href="#Footnote_E" class="fnanchor">[E]</a> the aged and infirm are left to shift for
themselves. I think the misery of these villages is
made to seem but the greater because of the large
house which so often stands close by. We looked
from the weary, silent old man and the row of tiny
bare cottages, to a gay young girl and a young man
in a kilt, who together strolled lazily towards the
large house just showing through the trees.</p>

<p class="caption">KILCHRENNAN.</p>

<p>When Mr. Hamerton wrote his "Painters' Camp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
in the Highlands" he suggested a new route from
Oban to Ballachulish by steamer up Loch Etive,
and then by coach through Glen Etive and Glencoe.
This is now one of the regular excursions
from Oban, and one of the finest, I think, in the
Highlands. In the glens we met no fewer than
five coaches, so that I suppose the excursion is fairly
popular. I wonder that Mr. Hamerton had a
thought for the amusement of tourists, who are to
him odious, as it seems necessary they should be
to all right-minded writers of travel. Now, he
might find loch and glens less fine. For the rest
of that day, being tourists ourselves, we bore with
all others patiently.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>With Taynuilt we left behind even the sparse
cultivation of the Highlands. From the boat we
saw that the mountain-slopes were unbroken by
road or path; there was scarce a house in sight.
Through Glen Etive the road was very rough, the
mountains were barren, and not a sheep or cow
was on the lower grassy hill-sides. It was all a
deer forest, the guard told us, and even the English
tourists in the coach exclaimed against the waste
of good ground. It is well to go first through
Glen Etive. Bare as it seemed to us, it was green
when compared to</p>


<h3>GLENCOE,</h3>

<p>where rocks lay on the road and in the stream
and on the hill-sides. The mountains rose bare
and precipitous from their very base, and trees
and grass found no place to grow.</p>

<p>The guard gave us the story of the massacre,
with additions and details of his own which I
have forgotten. At the end of the drive he
charged two shillings&mdash;for his trouble, I suppose.
People write of the emotions roused by scenery
and associations. I think it is afterwards, by reading
up on the subject, that one becomes first conscious
of them. However that may be, of one thing
I am certain: we have rarely been more flippant
than we were on that day. In Glen Etive J&mdash;&mdash; dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>covered
that Highland streams, where clear brownish
water flows over a bed of yellow, green, and red
stones, look like rivers of Julienne soup. In the
high moor at the head of the Glen we were chiefly
concerned with a lunch of milk and scones for
a shilling, and grumblings over Highland extortion.
In Glencoe, guard and driver pointed out the old
man of the mountain, who is here the Lord Chancellor,
and Ossian's Cave, on high in the rocky
wall, and stopped to show us the Queen's View.
But we were more interested in two cyclers push<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>ing
their machines up the steepest, stoniest bit of
road; in a man in a long black frock-coat and silk
hat with crape band, who carried an alpenstock
with an umbrella strapped to it, and strode solemnly
up the pass; in a species of gypsy van near Glencoe
Inn, in which, the guard explained, twelve
people and a driver travelled for pleasure. A girl
looking very pale and wrapped in shawls sat at
the inn door. The party had stopped on her account,
he said; the drive had made her ill&mdash;and
no wonder, we thought.</p>

</a></div>
<p class="caption">LOCH LEVEN, FROM BALLACHULISH.</p>

<p>The stony pass led to a pleasant green valley,
from which the road set out over the Bridge of
Glencoe for the shores of Loch Leven and</p>


<h3>BALLACHULISH.</h3>

<p>Almost at once it brought us to a field overlooking
the loch, where, apparently for our benefit,
sports were being held.</p>

<p>The droning of the pipes made quite a cheerful
sound, the plaids of the men a bright picture;
and when, two miles beyond, we found the hotel
with its windows turned towards the loch, we
made up our minds not to push on to Oban, but
to stay and spend Sunday here.</p>

<p>And so we had a second and longer look at the
sports. Young men vaulted with poles; others,
in full costume, danced Highland flings and the
sword dance. Two pipers took turns in piping.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
One had tied gay green ribbons to his pipe, and
he fairly danced himself as he kept time with his
foot. And while we watched we heard but Gaelic
spoken. We were in a foreign country.</p>

<p class="caption">OBAN.</p>

<p>The position of the hotel was the best thing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
about it. At dinner an irate clergyman and his
daughter took fresh offence at every course, until,
when it came to the rice-pudding, they could
stand it no longer and left the table. We were
less nice, and made a hearty meal; but we thought
so poorly of it that the next day, which was Sunday,
we found a lunch of bread and cheese and
beer more to our taste. This we ate at the inn in
Glencoe, in company with the clergyman and his
daughter. They were still sore&mdash;why, I could not
understand&mdash;about the pudding, and the clergyman
was consoling himself with a glass of good whiskey.</p>

<p>The following day we came to</p>


<h3>OBAN&mdash;</h3>

<p>the most odious place in the Highlands, I have
heard it called; the most beautiful place in the
world, Mr. William Black thinks. When the west
wind blows and the sun shines, there is nothing
like it for color, he told J&mdash;&mdash;. We had to take
his word for it. We found an east wind blowing
and gray mist hanging over town and bay, and we
could not see the hills of Mull. When we walked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
out in the late afternoon, it seemed a town of
hotels and photograph shops, into which excursion
trains were forever emptying excursionists and
never carrying them away again. Crowds were on
the parapetless, unsafe embankment; the bay was
covered with boats. In front of the largest hotels
bands were playing, and one or two of the musicians
went about, hat in hand, among the passers-by.
Fancy Hassler at Cape May sending one of
his men to beg for pennies! It was dull, for all
the crowd. The show of gayety was as little successful
as the attempt of a shivering cockney to
look comfortable in his brand-new kilt.</p>

<p>Altogether, Oban did not seem in the least lovely
until we could no longer see it. But as the
twilight grew grayer and the tide went out, the
great curve of the embankment was marked by a
circle of lights on shore and by long waving lines
of gold in the bay. At the pier, a steamer, just
arrived, sent up heavy clouds of smoke, black in
the gathering grayness. The boats one by one
hung out their lights. Oban was at peace, though
tourists still walked and bands still played.</p>

<p>It was gray and inexpressibly dreary the next day
at noon, when we took the boat for Tobermory,
in Mull. Through a Scotch mist we watched
Oban and its picturesque castle out of sight;
through a driving rain we looked forth on the
heights of Morven and of Mull. Sometimes the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
clouds lightened, and for a minute the nearer hills
came out dark and purple against a space of whitish
shining mist; but for the most part they hung
heavy and black over wastes of water and wastes
of land. Sir Walter Scott says that the Sound
of Mull is the most striking scene in the Hebrides;
it would have been fair to add, when storms
and mists give one a chance to see it. Pleasure
parties sat up on deck, wrapped in mackintoshes
and huddled under umbrellas. Our time was divided
between getting wet and drying off down-stairs.
The excitement of the voyage was the
stopping of the steamer, now in mid-stream in
"Macleod of Dare" fashion, now at rain-soaked
piers. Of all the heroes who should be thought
of between these two lands of romance, only the
most modern was suggested to us, probably because
within a few weeks we had been re-reading Mr.
Black's novel. But, just as in his pages, so in the
Sound of Mull, little boats came out to meet the
steamer. They lay in wait, tossing up and down
on the rough waters and manned with Hamishes
and Donalds. Into one stepped a real Macleod,
his collie at his heels; into another, an elderly
lady, who was greeted most respectfully by the
Hamish, as he lifted into his boat trunks marked
with the name of Fleeming Jenkin. This gave us
something to talk about; when we had last seen
the name it was in a publisher's announcement,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
which said that Mr. Stevenson was shortly to write
a biographical notice of the <i>late</i> Fleeming Jenkin.</p>

<p>At the piers, groups of people, no better off for
occupation than we, waited to see the passengers
land. We all took unaccountable interest in this
landing. At Salen there was an intense moment
when, as the steamer started, a boy on shore discovered
that he had forgotten his bag. At the next
pier, where a party of three got off, as their baggage
was carried after them, we even went the length of
counting up to forty bags and bundles, three dogs,
and two maids. We left them standing there,
surrounded by their property, with the rain pouring
in torrents and not a house in sight. This is
the way you take your pleasure in the Hebrides.
We were glad to see among the boxes a case of
champagne. At the last moment, one of the men,
from the edge of the pier, waved a brown paper
parcel, and told the captain that another like it had
been left aboard. I am afraid he had forgotten
something else; thence to Tobermory the captain
did but revile him.</p>


<h3>TOBERMORY</h3>

<p>is a commonplace town with a semicircle of well-to-do
houses on the shores of a sheltered bay. At
one end of the wooded heights that follow the
curve of the town is a big hotel; at the other,
Aros House, a brand-new castle, in among the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
trees. The harbor is shut in by a long, narrow island,
bare and flat. It seemed a place of endless rain
and mist. But when we thought the weather at its
worst, the landlady called it pleasant, and suggested
a two miles' walk to the light-house on the coast.
Children played on the street as if the sun shone.
We even saw fishing parties row out towards the
Sound.</p>

<p>We had to stay in Tobermory two interminable
days, for it was impossible at first to find a way
out of it. Our idea was to walk along the north
and then the west coast, and so to Ulva; but the
landlady was of the opinion that there was no getting
from Tobermory except by boat. Fishermen
in the bar-room thought they had heard of a rough
road around the coast, and knew that on it we
should find no inn. The landlord, to make an
end of our questions, declared that we must go to
Iona by the boat due the next morning at eight.
This seemed the only chance of escape unless we
were to return to Oban.</p>

<p>In the mean time there was nothing to do, nothing
to see. The hotel windows looked out on the
gray, cheerless bay, dotted with yachts. Once we
walked in the rain to the light-house, and back
across the moors. The wind never stopped blowing
a gale.</p>

<p>"If anybody wants to know what Mull's like in
summer," said J&mdash;&mdash;, in disgust, "all they've got<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
to do is to go to a New Jersey pine barren when
an equinoctial's on."</p>

<p>At our early breakfast the next morning, the
landlord told us that it was dark outside the bay.
It must have been wilder even than he thought.
No boat for Iona came.</p>

<p>It was after this disappointment that J&mdash;&mdash;, by
chance, in the post-office, met the Procurator Fiscal,
whatever he may be. We have good reason
to be grateful to him. He mapped out a walking
route to Salen, and thence to Loch-Na-Keal, at the
northern end of which is the island of Ulva&mdash;the
soft Ool-a-va which always leads the chorus of the
islands in Mr. Black's tragedy, "Macleod of Dare."</p>

<p>We did not care to walk to Salen in the rain;
we were not willing to spend another night in Tobermory.
Therefore, that same afternoon, when the
boat from Skye touched at the pier, we got on
board. We believed in the roughness of the sea
beyond the Sound when we saw tourists prostrate
in the cabin, with eloquent indifference to looks.
But it was short steaming to</p>


<h3>SALEN,</h3>

<p>where we faced wind and rain to walk about a
quarter of a mile to the hotel.</p>

<p>Here, as Dr. Johnson said in Glenelg, "of the
provisions, the negative catalogue was very copious."
The landlady asked us what we should like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
for supper; she might have spared herself the
trouble, since she had nothing to give us but ham
and eggs. However, we found the outlook less depressing
than at Tobermory. There was no commonplace
little town in sight, but only bare rolling
grounds stretching to a bay, and on the shores
the ruins of a real old castle, of which Mr. Abbey
once very unkindly made a drawing, so that J&mdash;&mdash;,
for his own sake, thought it best to let it alone.
There was, moreover, something to read. Lying
with the guide-books were the "Life of Dr. Norman
Mcleod," "Castle Dangerous," and the "Life
of the Prince Consort." J&mdash;&mdash; devoured them all
three, and the next day regaled me with choice
extracts concerning the domestic virtues of the
royal family.</p>

<p>When we awoke, the clouds were breaking.
Across the Sound of Mull they were low on the
heights of Morven, but the hill-sides were green,
streaked with sunshine. Above were long rifts
of blue sky, and in the bay a little yacht rocked
on glittering water. We ate more ham and eggs,
and made ready to begin our tramp at once.</p>

<p>Neither maid nor landlord could tell us if there
were inns on the road to Bunessan. In Mull a
man knows but his own immediate neighborhood.
In the hotels, the farthest explorations are to the
bed-rooms; in the cottages the spirit of enterprise
is less. The interior of the island is an unknown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
country. The adventurous traveller goes no farther
inland than Tobermory on the east coast, or
Bunessan on the west. The ordinary traveller
never goes ashore at all, but in the boat from
Oban makes the tour of Mull in a day. As a
consequence, there is no direct communication between
the two sides of the island. It is strange
that, though one of the largest of the Hebrides
and within easiest reach of the main-land, Mull
should be one of the least known and civilized.
It is not even settled. People respect Dr. Johnson
because in the days when steamboats were
not, and roads at the best were few, he made a
journey to the islands. But we cannot help thinking
that if this respect is measured by hardships,
we are far more worthy of it for having followed
him to Mull a century later. Wherever he and
Boswell went, guides and horses, or boats, as the
case might be, were at their disposal; the doors
of all the castles and large houses in the islands
were thrown open to them. We were our own
guides. It may be said that the steamboat was at
our service, but it could not always take us to
places we wished to see. If Dr. Johnson had to
ride over moorland on a pony too small for him,
he was sure that when evening came a Macquarry,
a Maclean, or a Macleod would be eager to make
him welcome. We walked on roads, it is true, but
they were bad, and not only were we not wanted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
at the castles, but we did not want to go to them
since they are now mostly in ruins; there was
chance, too, of our not coming to an inn at nightfall.
The inns of Mull are few and far between.
Besides, for all one knows, those mentioned in the
guide-book may be closed. If others have been
opened, there is no one to tell you of them.</p>

</a></div>
<p class="caption">COAST OF MULL.</p>

<p>However, we took the procurator's word for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
inn at Ulva, and started out again with our knapsacks,
which seemed but heavier on our backs after
several days' rest. All morning we tramped dreary
miles of moor and hill, with the wind in our faces,
and by lochs with endless curves, around which we
had to go, though we saw our journey's end just
before us. While we followed the northern shore
of Loch-Na-Keal, high Ben-More, with its head
among the clouds, was behind us. In front was
the Atlantic, with heavy showers passing over it,
and now blotting out far Staffa and the long ridge
of the Ross of Mull, an encircling shadow between
the ocean and the headland of Gribun; and now
sweeping across the loch and the near green island
of Inch-Kenneth.</p>

<p>A large house, with wide lawn and green fields
and well-clipped hedges, just at the head of Loch-Na-Keal,
and one or two small new cottages shut
in with flaming banks of fuchsias, showed what
Mull might be if in the island men were held in
as high account as rabbits and grouse. We saw the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
many white tails of the rabbits in among the ferns,
and though they live only to be shot, on the whole
we thought them better off than the solemn, silent
men and women who trudged by us towards Salen,
where it was market-day, for it is their fate to
live only to starve and suffer. The one man who
spoke to us during that long morning was a shepherd,
with a soft gentle voice and foreign Scotch,
whose sheep we frightened up the hill-side.</p>


<h3>ULVA</h3>

<p>lay so close to the shores of Mull as scarce to
seem a separate island. But the waters of the narrow
Sound were rough. The postman, who had
just been ferried over, held the boat as we stepped
into it from the slippery stones of the landing.
As he waited, he said not a word. They keep
silence, these people, under the yoke they have
borne for generations. The ferryman was away,
and the boy who had come in his place had hard
work to row against wind and waves, and harder
work to talk English. "I beg pardon," was his
answer to every question we asked.</p>

<p>The little white inn was just opposite the landing,
and we went to it at once, for it was late and
we were hungry. We asked the landlady if she
could give us some meat.</p>

<p>"Of course," she said&mdash;and her English was
fairly good&mdash;she could give us tea and eggs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, but meat," we repeated.</p>

<p>"Yes, of course," she said again; "tea and eggs."</p>

<p>And we kept on asking for meat, and she kept
on promising us tea and eggs, and I know not how
the discussion had ended, if on a sudden it had not
occurred to us that for her the word had none
other but its Scriptural meaning.</p>

<p>While she prepared lunch we sat on low rocks
by the boats drawn up high and dry on the stony
beach. At the southern end of the island was
Ulva House, white through an opening in a pleasant
wood, and surrounded by broad green pastures.
Just in front of us, close to the inn, a handful
of bare black cottages rose from the mud in
among rocks and bowlders. No paths led to the
doors; nothing green grew about the walls. Women
with pinched, care-worn faces came and went,
busy with household work, and they were silent
as the people we had met on the road. Beyond
was barrenness; not another tree, not another bit
of pasture-land was in sight. And yet, before the
people were brought unto desolation, almost all
the island was green as the meadows about the
laird's house; and so it could be again if men were
but allowed to cultivate the ground. Where weeds
and rushes and ferns now cover the hills and the
level places were once fields of grain and grass.
To-day only the laird's crops are still sowed and
reaped. Once there could be heard the many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
voices of men and women and children at work
or at play, where now the only sounds are the
roaring of the waters and the crack of the rifle.<a name="FNanchor_F" id="FNanchor_F" href="#Footnote_F" class="fnanchor">[F]</a>
Of all the many townships that were scattered
from one end of the island to the other, there
remains but this miserable group of cottages. The
people have been driven from the land they loved,
and sent hither and thither, some across the narrow
Sound, others far across the broad Atlantic.</p>

<p>The Highlands and the Hebrides are lands of
romance. There is a legend for almost every
step you take. But the cruelest of these are not
so cruel as, and none have the pathos of, the tales
of their own and their fathers' wrongs and wretchedness
which the people tell to-day. The old
stories of the battle-field, and of clan meeting clan
in deadly duel, have given way to stories of the
clearing of the land that the laird or the stranger
might have his shooting and fishing, as well as
his crops. At first the people could not understand
it. The evicted in Ulva went to the laird, as they
would have gone of old, and asked for a new home.
And what was his answer? "I am not the father
of your family." And then, when frightened
women ran and hid themselves at his coming, he
broke the kettles they left by the well, or tore into
shreds the clothes bleaching on the heather. And
as the people themselves have it, "in these and
similar ways he succeeded too well in clearing
the island of its once numerous inhabitants, scattering
them over the face of the globe." There
must have been cruelty indeed before the Western
Islander, who once loved his chief better than his
own life, could tell such tales as these, even in his
hunger and despair.</p>

<p class="caption">ROSS OF MULL, LOOKING TOWARDS IONA.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>
<p>I know it is pleasanter to read of bloodshed in
the past than of hunger in the present. A lately
published book on Ireland has been welcomed by
critics, and I suppose by readers, because in it is
no mention of evictions and crowbar brigades and
horrors of which newspapers make good capital.
I have never been in Ireland, and it may be that
you can travel there and forget the people. But
in the Hebrides the human silence and the desolate
homes and the almost unbroken moorland would
let us, as foreigners, think of nothing else. Since
our return we have read Scott and Mr. Hamerton
and Miss Gordon Cumming and the Duke of
Argyll, and many others who have helped to make
or mar the romance and history of the Highlands.
But the true story of the Highlands as they are
I think we learned for ourselves when we looked,
as we did at Ulva, from the laird's mansion to the
crofter's hovel. It is the story of the tyranny of
the few, the slavery of the many, which can be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
learned still more fully from the reports of the
Royal Commission, published by the English Government.</p>

<p>When we returned to the inn we had no thought
but to get away at once, how, we hardly knew.
The landlady suggested three plans. We could
wait until the morrow, when the Gomestra men, as
she, a native, called them, and not Gometra men, as
Mr. Black has it, would row us out to meet the
steamboat coming from Iona. How "Macleod of
Dare" like this would have been! We could be
ferried over the Sound, and walk back by Loch-Na-Keal,
the way we had come, then around its
southern shores, and so across to Loch Scridain, at
the head of which was an inn. Or we could sail
across Loch-Na-Keal, and thus cut off many miles
of the distance that lay between us and our next
resting-place. We must, however, decide at once;
there were two gentlemen below who would take
us in their boat, but if we did not want them, they
must go back to cut the laird's hay. Were we
willing to wait until evening, they would take us
for half price. The rain now fell on the loch, but
we made our bargain with the gentlemen on the
spot.</p>

<p>The landlady gave our sailing quite the air of
an adventure. We need not be alarmed, she said,
as indeed we had not thought of being; the only
danger was to the gentlemen coming home. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
found them at the landing, ballasting the boat with
stones and getting on their oil-skins. We suggested
that they should take us all the way to Bunessan,
but they would not hear of it. Only the older of
the two, an old gray-haired man, could speak English;
they would not venture out to sea in such
weather, he told us.</p>

<p>As we sailed past the white house we asked
him if he had ever heard of Dr. Johnson. He
shook his head and then turned to the other man,
and the two began to talk in Gaelic. "Toctor
Shonson, Toctor Shonson," we heard them say to
each other. But they both kept shaking their
heads, and finally the old man again said they had
never heard of him.</p>

<p>When the wind swept the rain from the hills of
Ulva, we could see that on the western side of the
island the strange basaltic formation like that of
Staffa begins. Near the low green shores of
Inch-Kenneth a yacht lay at anchor. It belonged
to one of the lairds of Mull, the boatman said.
The people, who have barely enough to live on
themselves, can still afford to support a yacht for
their landlord. How this can be is the real problem
of the Hebrides. To solve it is to explain the
crofter question without the aid of a Royal Commission.</p>

<p>On the Gribun shore the landing-place was a
long row of stones, slippery with wet sea-weed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
The old man gave me his arm and led me in safety
to the foot of the meadows beyond. He was the
gentleman the landlady had called him. A Frenchman
could not have been more polite. Nor was
there in his politeness the servility, which in England
makes one look to honest rudeness with relief.
Caste distinctions may be bitterly felt in the
homes of the Western Islanders, but in their manner
is something of the equality which French
republicans love. They can be courteous without
cringing. Englishmen call this familiarity. But
then the Englishman who understands true politeness
is the exception.</p>

<p>It was, if anything, wetter on land than it had
been on the water. To reach the road we waded
through a broad meadow knee-high in dripping
grass. The mist kept rising and falling, and one
minute we could see the islands&mdash;Ulva and Gometra
and Inch-Kenneth and even Staffa&mdash;and the next
only grayness. In the narrow pass over the headland
between Loch-Na-Keal and Loch Scridain the
clouds rolled slowly down the mountains on either
side, lower and lower, until presently we were
walking through them. And as we went, as was
proper in the land of Macleod of Dare, a strange
thing happened; for scarcely had the clouds
closed about us than a great gust of wind swept
through the pass and whirled them away for a
moment. Then the wind fell, and again we were
swallowed up in grayness, and could scarcely see.
Just as we were within sight of Loch Scridain,
down poured torrents of rain. A little farther on
and we were half-way up to our knees in a bridgeless
stream that came rushing down the mountains
across the road.</p>

</div>
<p class="caption">HEADLAND OF GRIBUN, FROM ULVA.</p>

<p>We passed two wind-and-rain-beaten villages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
and occasional lonely cottages, and the ruins of
others. Mr. Hamerton says that nothing is more
lovely to an artist than a Highland cottage after
a rain; but the trouble is, you seldom see it after
the rain, for in the Hebrides the rain it raineth
every day and always. We came, too, to one big
dreary house and a drearier kirk. The rest of the
way there was but the wet wilderness, with the
wet road following the curves of the loch, and
even striking a mile or so inland to cross with
the bridge a river which falls into it at its head.
The inn was on the opposite shore; a short-cut
lay across the water; there were boats moored to
the northern bank where we walked, but not a
ferryman to be found. A woman in a clean white
cap, who stood in a cottage door-way, did not even
know if there was a ferry.</p>

<p>Towards evening the rain stopped; the light of
the setting sun shone on the hills before us as it
seldom does except in pictures of the Hebrides;
but on a walking tour when the chance for pleasure
comes, one's capacity for enjoyment has gone.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
At the end of a day's tramp one can see little
beauty, save that of a good dinner and a soft bed,
both of which are the exception in the Hebrides.</p>

<p>The inn at</p>


<h3>KINLOCH</h3>

<p>was a two-storied cottage, with kitchen full of
women and tap-room full of geese and hens below
stairs, dining and sleeping rooms above. The bed-rooms
were all occupied&mdash;by the family, I suppose,
since we were given our choice; but after choosing,
everything had to be moved out before we
could move in. However, we made a shift to
change our shoes and stockings, and in the dining-room
we crouched over a big fire, while the steam
rose in clouds from our soaked tweeds. The landlady
came up at once with whiskey and glasses.</p>

<p>"And will you accept a glass from me?" she
asked.</p>

<p>This was the Highland hospitality of which one
reads, and it was more to our taste than the whiskey.</p>

<p>For supper of course we had ham and eggs, but
it took no less than two hours for the landlady to
cook them and to set the table. She was the sister
of the landlady at Ulva, she told us. "And it's
a good house my sister keeps whatever," she said;
and then she wanted to know, "Had the wee laddie,
Donald, ferried us over? And we had come
from Salen, and were we going to Bunessan? It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
will be twelve miles to Bunessan whatever. And
then to Iona?" It will be a great kirk we should
see there, she had heard; but she had never been
to Iona. She spoke excellent English, with the
soft, drawling accent we thought so pleasant to
hear, and we wished she could cook as well as she
talked.</p>

<p>While we waited, J&mdash;&mdash;, out of sympathy, fed a
lean hound on meat-lozenges. He looked so starved
that we could but hope each would prove for him
the substantial meal it is said to be on the label of
the box, and which we had not yet found it.</p>

<p>After supper it was two hours more before the
bedroom was ready, and I think we had rarely
been so tired. We sat nodding over the fire, sick
with sleep. When we could stand it no longer,
we made a raid upon the room while the landlady,
who spent most of her time on the stairs,
was on her hundredth pilgrimage below, and locked
ourselves in. After that, she kept coming back
with towels and one thing and another until we
were in bed and asleep.</p>

<p>We had ordered more ham and eggs for eight
o'clock in the morning, and asked to be awakened
at seven. We might have spared ourselves the
trouble&mdash;no one called us. It was half-past nine
before breakfast was on the table, and it would not
have been served then had not J&mdash;&mdash; gone into the
kitchen to see it cooked. The only difference be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>tween our morning and evening meal was in the
bill, where, according to island reckoning, tea and
ham and eggs called supper, are worth sixpence
more than eggs and ham and tea called breakfast.</p>

<p>At the last moment up came the landlady, again
with whiskey and glasses.</p>

<p>"And will you accept a glass from me?"</p>

<p>But indeed we could not. To begin a twelve
miles' walk with whiskey was out of the question.
We afterwards learned that this was but good
form on her part. The true Highlander always
expects to drink a wee drappie with the coming
and the parting guest. It would have been true
politeness for us to accept. However, we did not
know it at the time, and the whiskey was bad.
She seemed hurt by our refusal. I thought her
a shade less cordial when we came to say goodby.</p>

<p>The wind was still blowing a gale, but it drove
the clouds beyond the bald mountains towards Ben-More,
and brought no showers with it. Everything
had grown bright with the morning but
the cottages, and they, perhaps because of the contrast
with the blue loveliness of water and sky and
hills, seemed darker and more desolate than in
the rain. Here and there along the loch a few
were gathered in melancholy groups, pathless and
chimneyless, smoke pouring from door-ways and
through holes in the walls, mud at the very thresh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>olds.
For every cottage standing there was another
in ruins. On the top of a low hill, over
which we made a short-cut, was a deserted village,
conveniently out of sight of the road. No traveller,
unless he chanced upon it as we did, would
know of it. It was not high enough or far enough
from other cottages for the shielings upon which
the Duke of Argyll thinks so much false sentiment
has been wasted. We found a few black-faced
sheep in possession of the ruins, and before
them, I fear, have been driven not merely cattle
from summer pastures, but men from their only
homes. There were several school-houses between
Kinloch and Bunessan, and we half hoped that
these were in a measure responsible for roofless
walls and desolate hearths. But the truth is, the
Duke of Argyll and other landlords of Mull find
it less trouble to collect rents from a few large
tenants than from many small ones, and to suit
their convenience the people have had to go. It
is their land; why should they not do with it as
they think best?</p>

<p>Almost all this Ross of Mull, on which we now
were, belongs to the Duke of Argyll, the defender
of Scotland as it was and as it is; and I think
in all the Hebrides there is no place more desolate.
We saw perhaps more signs of bitter poverty
in Skye and in Barra. But in these islands
the evicted have settled again upon the crofts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
their friends or relations. Often it is because the
many are thus forced to live upon land that can
scarce support the few that all are so poor. But
the Islander loves his home as he once loved his
chief, and now hates his landlord, and he must be
in extremity indeed before he will go from it.
Knowing this, you feel the greatness of the misery
in the Ross of Mull, from which the people
have flown as if from a plague-stricken land.
The greater part of it is silent and barren as the
desert. We walked for miles, seeing no living
things save a mere handful of sheep grazing on
the hills, and the white sea-gulls perched on the
low sea-weed covered rocks of Loch Scridain.
And beyond the barren waste of land was the sea
without a sail upon its waters, and the lonely islands,
which we knew were no less desolate. The
cruel climate of this far northern country has had
little to do with the people's flight. Neither, indeed,
has natural barrenness. The soil in the
Highlands is not naturally barren, the Duke of
Argyll himself has said. The few large farms by
the way were good proof of what might be, even
in the rocky Ross of Mull.</p>

<p>It seemed odd in the midst of the wilderness to
meet two peddlers loaded with gay gilt frames.
They thought it a "blowy" day, and so did a man
who passed soon after in a dog-cart. But the
women in clean white caps whom we met on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
road could answer our questions only in streams
of Gaelic.</p>

<p>We saw no one else but men and women getting
in the harvest, or bending beneath great burdens
of sea-weed as they toiled up the hill from
the shores of the loch. There was a lonely graveyard
by the way; but nowhere does death seem
so great a blessing as we thought it must be here.</p>

<p>It was a long twelve miles, and the knapsacks
were growing heavier with each day. But we
were walking for our lunch; there were no inns
on our road. For one reason or another, to me it
was our hardest day's work. I think I must have
starved had not J&mdash;&mdash; slung my knapsack on
his already heavily laden shoulders. At the last,</p>


<h3>BUNESSAN</h3>

<p>came as a surprise. We were looking sadly at the
endless line of road over the moors in front of us,
when we turned a corner, and there was the little
white town, with a pleasant inn, close to the waters
of Loch Slach.</p>

<p>We had to wait&mdash;we were growing used to
waiting&mdash;for our lunch; but at last when it came
it seemed a banquet. We were not asked to eat
either ham or eggs. Altogether, we were so well
pleased that we brought the day's walk to an end.
But it seemed that the maid who came to the door
was less pleased with us. Our knapsacks, too large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
for comfort, were too small for respectability.
Our clothes were weather-worn. The landlord
bade her show us to a bedroom; but before we
had finished our lunch she had locked every door
in the house, carefully leaving the keys on the
outer side, and, in her zeal, locking one man in.
This, however, we did not learn until later, when
English people staying in the inn told us what
suspicious characters we were. They said she was
stupid, which we had already found out for ourselves.</p>

<p>Bunessan is the show-place of the Ross of Mull;
steamers occasionally land at a pier on the loch,
two miles distant. Tourists come to the inn for
the fishing. If they go no farther into the island,
they probably carry away with them impressions
of well-to-do people and benevolent landlords&mdash;the
impressions, probably, the Duke of Argyll wishes to
produce. After Kilpatrick and the other wretched
groups of cottages we had passed in the morning,
it did indeed seem happy and prosperous. It may
be that we should have been less struck with it and
its inn had it not been for the things we had already
seen and experienced. Certainly, at dinner, dishes
which we thought luxuries were found fault with
by the rest of the company. But then they had
their own opinion of Bunessan. They had taken it
on trust, after hearing it praised; but no sooner had
they come than they wished themselves away again.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
One suggested that friends should be induced to stay
for a summer and educate the place, which might
thus be made bearable for them in the future;
but the others would not hear of it&mdash;one trial
was quite enough. We were all very confidential
about our plans, and took pleasure in mutually discouraging
each other. J&mdash;&mdash; and I were foolish,
they said, to go to Iona, where the cathedral was so
insignificant that from the steamer they mistook it
for the parish church. We, on our side, declared it
worse than folly for them to go from Bunessan to
Tobermory, the dreariest spot in all the dreariness
of Mull. In the end we agreed that our coming to
the island was a mistake, and that no one but Mr.
Black could have a good word to say for it. Somehow,
we made it seem&mdash;and it was a comfort to
find some one else to abuse&mdash;as if he had brought
us here under false pretences. But, indeed, whoever
thinks to find Mull as it is described in
"Macleod of Dare" cannot but be disappointed.
Castle Dare must have been not very far from
Bunessan, on the Ross of Mull. It was to this very
inn Lady Macleod wished to send Gertrude White
and her father; and when you have seen the home
of the Macleods for yourself, you would have, like
Mr. Black, no mercy for Sir Keith, but you would
spare his sweetheart.</p>

<p>The fact is, Mr. Black's descriptions are misleading,
though I must admit that even as we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
found fault with him, one of his strange things
happened; for, far out beyond the loch and its
purple hills we saw Staffa, and the sea below and
the sky above it, turned to gold as the sun sank
into the Atlantic. But then, as a rule, the things
that happen in Mull are less strange than disagreeable.
For one evening's loveliness, you must put
up with hours of cold and damp discomfort. Of
course, if you own a castle or a yacht, you can improve
your point of view.</p>

<p>In the morning after this beautiful sunset, the
wind blew the rain through the window in gusts
over our toilet-table. Again no one called us.
The morning hours of the Hebrides are even later
than those of London, which we had hitherto supposed
the latest in the working world. When we
went down-stairs there were cups and saucers and
plates on the breakfast-table, but nothing else;
when we asked for our bill the maid said we should
have it in a wee bittee, which we knew to mean
long hours, and J&mdash;&mdash;, as at Kinloch, took matters
into his own hands.</p>

<p>For the first time we felt our superiority as we
shouldered our knapsacks. Because of the early
rain and wind, the other people in the inn had
given up the boat to Tobermory. Already, breakfast
over, the rain stopped and clouds grew light.
We were on our way to Iona while they still made
plans to follow us with their babies and bundles.</p>

<p class="caption">&quot;ONE OF HIS STRANGE THINGS HAPPENED.&quot;</p>

<p>The road lay for six miles over the moors.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
There were two or three large houses with cultivated
fields, a few black dreary cottages, and the
ruins of others. But this end of the Ross of Mull
was mostly, as when David Balfour walked across
it, bog and brier and big stones. The coast was
all rock, great piles of red granite jutting out in
uneven masses into the sound that separates Iona
from the Ross. When we reached it the ferryman
had just come and gone. It was the 11th of
August, and men with guns, in readiness for the
morrow, were getting into a dog-cart, its horses'
heads turned towards Bunessan. Two fishermen,
in a boat filled with lobster nets, rowed to the tiny
landing. We asked them to take us across, but
with a word they refused. There was nothing to
do but to sit on the rocks and wait, in fear lest the
party from Bunessan, with their children and endless
boxes and bundles&mdash;thirteen, one man told us
he had&mdash;should overtake us and give us and our
knapsacks no chance in the inns of Iona.</p>

<p>Wind and rain blew in our faces. The fishermen
made off in their little boat, hugging the
rocky shore. Above us, on the granite, were two
cottages, no less naked and cold. Across the Sound
we looked to a little white town low on the wind-swept
water, and to a towered cathedral dark against
the gray-green rocks. A steamer had just brought
Cook's daily pilgrims to St. Columba's shrine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">All</span> things come to those who wait, even the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
ferry-men of the Hebrides; but the steamer had
carried the pilgrims far from St. Columba's Island
towards Staffa before the little ferry-boat sailed
with the wind, round the rocks, into the tiny bay
by the landing. One passenger was put out, and a
woman ran down from the black cottages for a
bundle done up in a handkerchief, from which, as
she took it, fell out broken pieces of bread and
meat. Unconsciously, these people are always reminding
you of their poverty.</p>

<p>There was no sailing in the teeth of the wind.
The ferry-man and a small boy with him rowed,
keeping under the shelter of the rocks as far as
possible. At first both were silent. But we were
fast learning that this silence is not the stupidity or
surliness which the stranger in the islands is apt to
think it. It comes rather of the sadness which has
been the Western Islander's inheritance for generations,
and of his shyness in speaking the foreign
Scotch&mdash;that is, if he can speak it at all&mdash;for
which he is so often laughed at. Once you break<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
through the silence, and show the people that you
do not look upon them as children or as slaves,
they are friendly enough.</p>

<p>All this part of the Ross of Mull, as far as we
could see, belonged to the Duke of Argyll, our
ferry-man said. There had been trouble here as in
Tiree, and the Commission was coming in a week.
He had only his house and his boat. Five shillings
and sixpence a year he paid; it was not much, but
it was about the land there was trouble, and he had
no land. We might have agreed with him and
thought his rent no great thing, had we not seen
his bare cottage, stranded on the bare rocks, probably
built by himself or by his father before him.
As it was, it seemed to us, if there was any question
of payment, it should have been the other
way.</p>

<p>Our stay in Iona was the one perfect part of our
journey. In the first place, we were free to wander
where and how we chose without thought of long
miles to be walked before nightfall, and, better still,
without our knapsacks, which we left in the inn.
It was no small surprise to learn that we had our
choice of three hotels. After careful study of
"Macleod of Dare," we rather expected to be
stranded on an almost uninhabited island. We can
now recommend Mr. Black, on his next visit, to try
the very excellent house at which we stayed. This
was St. Columba's Inn. We went to it, not so much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
to do honor to the saint as because it was the biggest
in the place, the nearest to the cathedral, and
commanded the finest view.</p>

<p class="caption">IN THE TRANSEPT OF THE CATHEDRAL, IONA.</p>

<p>Southward, it looked to the broken walls of the
nunnery rising high above house roofs and chimneys,
and farther to a sweep of water, and farther
still to the Ross of Mull, the low black rock of Erraid,
the isle Mr. Stevenson has made famous, at
its far end. In the distance, shadowy islands lay
over the gray sea. To the north was the cathedral
and the ruined monastery.</p>

<p>The inn was quite full, but the landlady prom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>ised us a room in the manse, a short way down the
road.</p>

<p>Iona is the show-place by which we fancied the
Duke of Argyll must hope to answer the question,
once in a great while asked, about misery, terrorism,
extortion, rent, in the Hebrides. Strangers
come to the islands only to fish or to shoot. It is
the exception when, as at Iona, there are sights to
be seen. They have time to give only a glance to
the Islander and his home. In Iona this home
seems decent enough; if you stop to ask the Islander
what he thinks, however, I doubt if it will be
praise alone you will hear of his model landlord.
Above the stony beach, where boats lie among the
rocks, is the village street, lined with white cottages;
and beyond, fields of tall grain and good
pasture slope upward to the foot of the low green
hills, whose highest peak rises to the north of the
village, a background for the cathedral. Many of
the cottages are new, others are whitewashed into
comparative cheerfulness. The crops on the lower
ground, the sheep and cattle on the hills, are pleasanter
to see in an island where men live than endless
wastes of heather. In Iona the civilization of
the monks of the Dark Ages has survived even the
modern sportsman.</p>

<p class="caption">IONA.</p>

<p>It is the fashion among writers of guide and
other books about Iona to call it a desolate, lonely
little isle. That it is little I admit; but you must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
go to the other side of the Sound for the loneliness
and desolation. In proportion to its size, it seemed
to us the most cultivated island of the Hebrides. I
have heard it argued that for the Duke of Argyll
not to forfeit his ownership was a true charity to his
tenants, as if Iona was still the desert St. Columba
found it. But I think its rental would be found a
fair return for the charity of a landlord. As for the
favorite myth that Iona is far out in the Hebridean
Sea, I hardly know how it could have arisen, since
the island is within easy reach of the main land and
of Mull. There is no history of its old monastery
that does not tell how the pilgrim coming to it
from the Ross of Mull had but to call a summons
from the granite rocks, and the monks would hear
the cry and make ready to meet him in their boats.
If this be true, however, his voice must have been
phenomenal. The modern pilgrim could no more
do this than he could wield the long sword or
pull the crossbow of men of old. In our time a
steamer comes to Iona every day from Oban, and
twice a week another stops on its way to and
from Glasgow and the Outer Hebrides. If Iona
lay so near American shores it would long since
have become a Bar Harbor or a Campo Bello. Even
where it is it has its crowds of visitors. The writer
who on one page tells you of its loneliness, on
the next mourns its daily desecration when tourists
eat sandwiches among the ruins.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p class="caption">TOMB OF MACLEOD.</p>

<p>These ruins, like everything else in Iona, belong
to the Duke of Argyll. They are kept locked
except when the keeper of the keys opens them
to sight-seers. It may interest his Grace to know
that we trespassed, climbing over the low stone
walls into the cathedral enclosure. While we were
there we were alone, save for black sheep, the
modern successors of the monks. It is a fact that
as we stood with our feet upon Macleod of Macleod's
tomb, one of the black sheep&mdash;probably the
very same which frightened Gertrude White in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
the moonlight&mdash;baaed at us. But the sun was
shining, and we did not screech; we merely said
<i>shoo</i> to it, and remarked upon its impudence.</p>

<p>If our piety, with Dr. Johnson's, did not grow
warmer among the ruins of Iona, at least our way
of seeing them was not unlike Boswell's. Perhaps
this is why we think he showed more commonsense
in Iona than elsewhere on his journey. He
did not trouble to investigate minutely, he says,
"but only to receive the general impression of solemn
antiquity, and the particular ideas of such
objects as should of themselves strike my attention."
But indeed, unless you have a lifetime to
spend in Iona, unless you are an architect or an
archæologist, there is little need to care where the
exact site of infirmary or refectory or library
may be, or to whom this shrine was set up, that
tombstone laid, or in what year walls were built,
windows opened. It is enough to see how beautiful
the monks could make the holy place they
loved, here on this rough northern coast, as in
among the vineyards and olives of the south, as
in English fenland and wooded valley.</p>

<p>But if Boswell's impression was one of disappointment,
ours was one of wonder to find the ruins
so much more perfect than we had expected, and so
beautiful, not only with the beauty of impressiveness
as a whole, but with a grace and refinement
of detail one does not look for in the far north.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
Much early Italian work is not more graceful
than the carving on the capitals, the tracery in the
windows, the door-way leading into the sacristy,
the arches that spring from the cloister walls to
their outer arcade in the monastery and church
founded by St. Columba. If, as has been said, no
ivy covers the walls, when we were there yellow
flowers had pushed their way between the stones,
while windows and rounded arches made a frame-work
for the unbroken blue of sea and sky and
pale distant hills. For so long as we were in the
cathedral, the sun shone as if, instead of Hebridean
seas, the Mediterranean lay beyond. True, this did
not last half a morning; it rained before night;
but the very breaks in the sunshine, and the way
the clouds came and went, made the day more
beautiful.</p>

<p>It is strange to see this wonderful work of other
days in an island where, owing to their present
masters, men can now scarce support existence.
Centuries of progress or deterioration&mdash;which is
it?&mdash;lie between the cathedral, lovely even in
ruin, and the new ugly kirk close by. And yet
when men had time to make their world beautiful
the harvest was as rich. There was enough to
eat and to spare for the stranger when the Celtic
knots and twists were first carved on the cross
standing by the cathedral door and looking seaward,
and on the tombs lying within the chancel.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
But, and more's the pity, the same cannot be said
to-day, when tombs are crumbling, and pale green
lichens cover the carving of the cross. You feel
this contrast between past and present still more
in the graveyard by St. Oran's chapel, into which
also we made our way over a stone wall. The
long grass has been cleared from the gray slabs,
where lie the mitred bishops and the men in
armor, or where the intricacy of the Celtic designs
makes space for a ship with its sails spread.
They are "only gravestones flat on the earth," as
Boswell says, and now neatly placed in senseless
rows for the benefit of the tourist. But who
would exchange them for the well-polished granite
obelisks of the modern stone-cutter which rise
at their side?</p>

<p>The old road leads from the cathedral, past
McLean's weather-worn cross&mdash;which is so thin
you wonder that it still withstands the strong winds
from the sea&mdash;to the nuns' convent, whose ruins and
tombs show it to have been only less fine than the
monastery. Here the gate was thrown open. A
small steam-yacht, which we could see lying at
anchor in the Sound below, had just let loose a
dozen yachtsmen upon the loneliness of Iona, and
they were being personally conducted through the
nunnery.</p>

<p>We trespassed no more, except in fields on the
western side of the island, whither we walked by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
the very road, for all I know, along which St. Columba
was carried in the hour before death, that
he might once more see the monks working on
the land he had reclaimed, and there give them
his last blessing. But if we trespassed, no one objected.
The men whom we met greeted us in
Gaelic, which, when they saw we did not understand,
they translated into a pleasant good-day or
directions about our path.</p>

<p>There were many other places we should have
seen. But since the whole island was a proof of
St. Columba's wisdom in settling on it, nothing
was to be gained by a visit to the particular spot
where he landed or where he set up a cairn.
And as for the Spouting Cave, we took the guide-book's
word for it; for as Dr. Johnson would say,
we were never much elevated by the expectation
of any cave. Instead of sight-seeing, we stayed
on the western shore, looking out beyond the low
white and grass-grown sand-dunes and the bowlder-made
beach to the sea, with its many rocky
isles, the fear of seamen, black upon the waters.
It is just such a coast as Mr. Stevenson has described
in his "Merry Men." And, indeed, since
I have written this I have read in his "Memoirs
of an Islet" that it is this very coast, though more
to the south of Iona, where the <i>Christ-anna</i> and
the <i>Covenant</i> went down to the bottom, there to
rot with the <i>Espirito Santo</i> and her share of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
treasures of the Invincible Armada. When Columba
sailed from Ireland to Hebridean seas the
Merry Men had long since begun their bonny
dance, for they are as old as the rocks against
which they dash, and these rocks are older than
man. When you know the dangers of this coast
you have no little respect for the saint who dared
them. St. Columba and his disciples, who set up
cross and bell on lonely St. Kilda and the far
Färöe Islands, were the Stanleys and Burtons of
their time.</p>

<p>People who have never heard of crofters and
their troubles can tell you all about St. Columba
and his miracles. In Iona he interested us chiefly
because all that is left of his and his followers'
work gives the lie to modern landlords. Land in
the Hebrides, they say, is only fit for deer and
grouse. St. Columba showed that it could be
made fit for man as well.</p>

<p>The landlady of St. Columba's Inn is true to
the traditions of the island. She is as unwilling
to turn the stranger from her door as were the
abbots of St. Columba's monastery. In her own
way she performs miracles and finds room for every
one who comes. At first we thought that her
miracles were worked at our expense. During our
absence the party from Bunessan had arrived. Although
their boxes were on the rocks of the Ross
of Mull, awaiting the ferry-man's convenience, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
their very numbers they had gained the advantage
we feared, and had quietly stepped into the room
in the manse, of which we had neglected to take
possession. We were now quartered in the school-house.
However, to judge from our comfort there,
we lost nothing by the change.</p>

<p>It was at the late supper that we enjoyed the
"dairy produce" of which Miss Gordon Cumming
writes with rapture. It was a simple meal, such
as one might have shared with St. Columba himself.
The breakfasts and dinners, I should add,
were less saintly, and therefore more substantial.
As for the rest of the island, the fare is regulated
by poverty and the Duke. We make a great to-do
at home over the prohibition question, but in the
Highlands they manage these matters more easily.
Ducal option, we were told, reigns throughout the
island. And yet the people of Iona are not grateful
for thus being spared the trouble of deciding
for themselves upon a subject whereon so few
men agree. It has been whispered that drunkenness
is not unknown in the Blessed Isle, and that
natives have been seen by strangers&mdash;oh, the scandal
of it!&mdash;reeling under the very shadow of the
cathedral.</p>

<p>A white-haired clergyman, with pleasant old-fashioned
manners and Gladstone collar, presided
at supper. He introduced us at once to his family.
"My son"&mdash;and he waved his hand towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
a youth we had seen crossing the fields with his
color-box&mdash;"my son is an artist; he is studying
in the Royal Academy. He has already sold a
picture for forty pounds. Not a bad beginning,
is it? And my daughter," and he lowered his
voice deferentially, "will soon be in the hands of
the critics. She has just made some wonderfully
clever illustrations for an old poem that hit her
fancy!"</p>

<p>It was pleasant to see his fatherly pride. For
his sake we could have wished her in an easier
position.</p>

<p>Evidently, when you have exhausted saintly gossip
in Iona you are at the end of your resources.
The clergyman and two or three others with him
were as eager to hear where we had been and
where we were going and what we had seen, as if
they had had nothing to talk about for a fortnight.
We had decided to take the <i>Dunara Castle</i> from
Glasgow, and in it to steam to Coll and Tiree and
the Long Island. We had heard of the steamer,
as you hear of everything in the Hebrides, by
chance. And now the old man was all for having
us change our minds. Here we were, safe in Iona,
he said; why should we brave the dangers of the
wild coast? Another man thought we had better
not go to Harris; he had arrived there one Saturday
evening, intending to remain two weeks; but
the midges would give him no peace, and he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
left with the steamer on Monday morning. The
only comfort he could give was that they would
feed us well on the <i>Dunara Castle</i>. It is strange
that in Scotland, no matter what your plans may
be, your fellow-tourists are sure to fall foul of them.</p>

<p>It was after this the clergyman brought out of
his pocket a handful of the new coins, which we
had not then seen.</p>

<p>"It's an ugly face," said J&mdash;&mdash;, thinking only
of the coin, though it would have been no libel
had he referred to her gracious Majesty herself.</p>

<p>But the clergyman was down upon him at once.
"I cannot let any one speak disrespectfully of my
queen in my presence," he cried; "I love her too
dearly to hear a word against her."</p>

<p>And he told us how, that afternoon, he had
climbed to the top of the highest hill in Iona;
and standing where Columba had stood so many
hundreds of years ago, and remembering that this
was the Jubilee year of his beloved sovereign, he
dropped a new shilling into the cairn which marks
the spot where the monks first made their home.</p>

<p>And yet I have a friend who, in the pages of
the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i>, has tried to prove that sentiment
is fast decaying.</p>

<p>Later, when this same sentimentalist told us of
the poverty, hunger, and misery in Iona, we
thought that the shilling might have been dropped
to better purpose.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>It was on a gray morning that an old Hamish
rowed us and two other passengers and a load of
freight to the</p>


<h3>"DUNARA CASTLE,"</h3>

<p>which had dropped anchor in the middle of the
Sound. On deck we found four young sportsmen
in knickerbockers and ulsters, their backs turned
upon the cathedral, firing at sea-gulls and missing
them very successfully. In fact, I might as well
say here, they kept on firing and missing so long
as they were on the steamer. A man with a wife,
four children, three maids, and a deckful of baggage,
was already preparing to get off at Bunessan.
The domestic energy of the Englishman is only
less admirable than his business-like methods of
pleasure. A party of Lowlanders were playing
cards. A man of universal authority was telling a
small group of listeners all about the geology and
religion, the fishing and agriculture, of the islands.
But as we sat in a corner, sheltered from the bitter
cold wind, the talk that came to us was mostly
of sport.</p>

<p>"I played that brute for half an hour!"</p>

<p>"I was fishing with a worm, I think."</p>

<p>"The best thing for shooting rooks is an air-gun."</p>

<p>"He wasn't a particularly good shot."</p>

<p>And all the time the brave sportsmen kept
showing us what particularly bad shots they were.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
Is Tartarin's <i>Chasse de Casquettes</i> really so much
funnier than what is called sport in England?</p>

<p>Suddenly one of the Scotchmen, leaving his
cards to look about him, gave the talk an unexpected
literary turn. "That feller, Louis Stevverson,"
he said, "laid one o' the scenes o' his
Keednopped here," and he pointed to the Ross
and Erraid.</p>

<p>"Woo's 'e?" said a cockney.</p>

<p>"'Arts is trumps," announced a third, and literature
was dropped for more engrossing themes.</p>

<p>Emerson was right. It would be a waste of
time for the literary man to play the swell. Even
the handsome and gentlemanly authors of Boston,
who are praised by Arlo Bates, when they become
known to the world at large may be but "fellers!"</p>

<p>From the Sound we steamed past the great
headland of Gribun, with the caves in its dark
rocks, and into Loch Slach to the pier near Bunessan.
The sportsmen were the first to alight, and,
with guns over their shoulders, they disappeared
quickly up the hill-side. The father of the family,
like a modern Noah, stood on the pier to count
his wife, children, maid, boxes, bundles, fishing-rods,
and gun-cases, and to see them safely on dry
land. It was fortunate for the original Noah that
he did not have a whole ship's company to <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'fee'">feed</ins>
when he left the Ark. We were some time putting
off and taking on freight. At the last mo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>ment, back ran the four sportsmen, bearing one
bird in triumph. They parted with it sadly and
tenderly. It was pathetic to see their regret after
they had given it to a fisherman, who seemed embarrassed
by the gift. I think they knew that it
was the last bird they would bring down that day.</p>

<p>Then again we steamed past Gribun. Beyond
it rose Inch-Kenneth and Ulva, really "Ulva dark"
this morning. And one by one we left behind
us, Iona, its white sands shining, its cathedral
standing out boldly against the sky; Staffa, for a
time so near that we could see the entrance to the
great cave with its clustered piers; Fladda, Lunga,
and the Dutchman's Cap. It was a page from
"Macleod of Dare." And what were the Dhu
Harteach men saying now? we could not help
asking. Everywhere we looked were tiny nameless
islands and bits of rock, sometimes separated
only by a narrow channel. And now the
sun shone upon us in our corner and made us
warm. And even after the hills of Mull had begun
to go down on the horizon, and Iona and Staffa
had faded into vague shadows, we could see the
Dutchman, like a great Phrygian cap set upon the
waters.</p>

<p>Straight out we went to Tiree, a long, treeless
strip of land with low hills at one end, and a wide,
sandy, Jersey-like beach. A few houses, scattered
here and there, were in sight. There was no pier.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
A large boat, with three men at each of the four
long oars, came out to meet the steamer, and into
it were tumbled pell-mell men and women, and
tables, and bags of meal, and loaves of bread, and
boxes. It is another of the Duke of Argyll's islands.
Looking at it from the steamship point of
view, one could not but wonder if as much good
might not be done for people, whose only highway
is the ocean, by the building of a pier as by prohibition
laws enforced by a landlord. As in Iona,
so in Tiree, no spirits can be bought or sold. It
is one of the anomalies of paternal government that
the men made children turn upon their kind fatherly
ruler. The crofters of Tiree have given
trouble even as have those of Skye and Lewis.
They are shielded from drunkenness, and yet they
complain that they have been turned from the
land that once was theirs to cultivate, and that
their rents have been for long years so high that
to pay them meant starvation for their families.
Though these complaints are explained by the
Duke as "phenomena of suggestion" to the Commissioners,
part at least seemed well founded on
fact. Instead of £1251 18<i>s.</i> according to his own
estimate, his Grace, according to that of the Commission,
is now entitled to but £922 10<i>s.</i> from the
island of Tiree.</p>

<p>We had not time to land, but steaming past its
miserable shores, it seemed dreary enough. St.
Columba showed what he thought of it when he
sent penitents there to test their sincerity. The
island of Coll, to which Dr. Johnson and Boswell
were carried in a storm, was as flat and stupid and
dreary. We had come as far as Coll, partly because
of the Doctor's visit. But from this time
until we left the Hebrides we were so much taken
up with what we saw as scarce to give him another
thought. For a while we went many miles astray
from his route.</p>

</div>
<p class="caption">CASTLE BAY, FROM BARRA.</p>

<p>When you steam from Tiree and Coll, a broad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
stretch of the Atlantic lies between you and the
Long Island. If I had my choice, I would rather
cross the Channel from Newhaven to Dieppe, and
that is saying the worst that can be said. The
sunshine for the day came to an end. It was
cruelly cold. The sportsmen fell prone upon the
deck, and the intervals between their now languid
shots were long. The man of authority shut himself
up in his state-room, the best on the steamer.
The card-players sat sad and silent. We, for our
part, could only think of our folly in coming, and
wonder if we too must be sick. Surely walking
could not be greater misery than this. Though in
these seas you are never quite out of sight of land,
and never clear of the big and little rocks cropping
up all around you, it was not until late in the afternoon
that we came again close to large islands.
They were wild and desolate, with hardly a house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
and but few cattle and sheep on their rocky shores.
One or two boats, with brown sails raised, were
jumping and pitching over the waves.</p>

<p>The gray wretchedness of the afternoon was a
fit prelude to Barra. When we came to Castle
Bay, rain was falling upon its waters, on the battlemented
castle perched upon a rocky, sea-weed-covered
islet, and on the town, set against a background
of high bare hills. But the steamer stopped,
and we went ashore to look about us. A few ugly
new houses, shops with plate-glass windows, often
cited as proofs of the island's prosperity, and then
the real Barra: a group of black cottages&mdash;compared
to which those of Mull were mansions, those
of Kilchrennan palaces&mdash;running up and down the
rocky hill-side. Only by a polite figure of speech
can the stone pile in which the Hebridean crofter
makes his home be called a cottage. It is, as it
was described many years ago, but "a heavy
thatched roof thrown over a few rudely put together
stones." The long low walls are built of
loose stones blackened by constant rain. The
thatched roof, almost as black, is held in place
without by a net-work of ropes, within by rafters
of drift-wood. The crofter has no wood save that
which the sea yields, and yet in some districts he
must pay for picking up the beams and spars
washed up on his wild shores, just as he must for
the grass and heather he cuts from the wilder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
moorland when he makes his roof. Not until you
come close to the rough stone heap can you see
that it is a house, with an opening for door-way,
one tiny hole for window. From a distance there
is but its smoke to distinguish it from the rocks
strewn around it.</p>

<p>At Castle Bay, where many of these "scenes
of misery," as Pennant called them one hundred
years ago, were grouped together, there was not
even the pretence of a street, but just the rock,
rough, ragged, and broken, as God made it. The
people who live here are almost all fishermen, and,
as if in token of their calling, they have fashioned
the thatch of their roofs into the shape of boats;
one cottage, indeed, is topped with a genuine boat.
There were a few chimneys, but smoke came pouring
from the doors, from holes in the thatch and
walls. Many of the roofs bore a luxuriant growth
of grass, with here and there a clump of daisies or
of the yellow flowers which give color to Highland
roads. But this was all the green we saw on
their hill-side of rock and mud.</p>

<p>Through open door-ways we had glimpses of
dark, gloomy interiors, dense with smoke. We
did not cross a threshold, however; to seek admittance
seemed not unlike making a show of the
people's misery. The women and girls who passed
in and out, and stood to stare at us, looked strong
and healthy. Theirs is a life which must either kill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
or harden. Many were handsome, with strangely
foreign, gypsy-like faces, and so were the bonneted
men at work on the pier. It may be that there
is truth in the story which gives a touch of Spanish
blood to the people of the Outer Hebrides.
If the ships of the Armada went down with all
their treasure, it is said that their crews survived,
and lived and took unto themselves wives in the
islands, from which chance of deliverance was
small. We heard only Gaelic spoken while we
were at Castle Bay. The people of Great Britain
need not go abroad in search of foreign parts;
but an Englishman who only wants to see the
misery and wrongs of nations foreign in name as
well as in reality, would find little pleasure in
Barra.</p>

<p>When we left the steamer the four sportsmen
were getting off with their baggage, of which there
was no small quantity. When we returned, hours
later, they were getting in again. The one hotel
in Barra was full. For consolation, I suppose,
they shut themselves up in their state-room, and
changed their trousers for the third time that day.</p>

<p>Their return brought to an end our bargaining
for their state-room. The night in the ladies'
cabin was one long nightmare. The steamer
pitched and tossed as if she were still crossing the
open Atlantic. At the many stopping-places there
was a great noise of loading and unloading. At
midnight a mother, with her two babies and nurse,
came to fill the unoccupied berths.</p>

<p class="caption">TOWN OF BARRA.</p>

<p>J&mdash;&mdash;, in the saloon, fared little better. But the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
advantage of the restless night was that it sent us
up on deck in time to see the eastern hills grow
purple against the golden light of coming day.
As in the evening, there was still land on either
side. All the morning we went in and out of
lochs and bays, and through sounds, and between
islands. Indeed, I know of no better description
of the Outer Hebrides than the quotation given
in the guide-book: "The sea here is all islands
and the land all lakes." And the farther north
we went, the drearier seemed this land&mdash;a fitting
scene for the tragedy enacted on it, which, though
now many years old, is ever young in the memory
of the people; for it was here in Uist that, in
1851, men and women were hunted like beasts,
tracked by dogs to the caves and wilds where
they lay in hiding, bound hand and foot, and cast
upon ships waiting to carry them against their
will across the Atlantic. We might have thought
that no life had been left upon the islands but for
an occasional wire fence, a sprinkling of sheep on
the greener hill-sides, and lonely cottages, with thin
clouds of blue peat-smoke hovering over them to
show that they were not mere rocks. Once, stretching
across the wilderness we saw telegraph poles
following the coast-line. It is wise to let them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
make the best showing possible. Some of the
islands are cut off telegraphically from the rest
of the world.</p>

<p>We stopped often. At many of the landings
not a house was to be seen. As a rule, there was
no pier. The steamer would give her shrill whistle,
and as it was re-echoed from the dreary hills
huge black boats came sailing out to meet us. Instead
of boats waiting for the steamer, as in the
Mississippi, here she waited for them. And when
they had dropped their sails, and rounded her bows
and brought up alongside her lower deck, there tumbled
into them men and women, and loaves, and old
newspapers, and ham bones, and bits of meat, for in
the islands there are always people on the verge of
starvation.</p>

<p>At Loch Maddy, in North Uist, the brave warriors
left us, and other sportsmen in ulsters and
knickerbockers, and with many fishing-rods, came
to take their place. On shore stood a man in
plain, unassuming kilt, in which he looked at home.
We liked to fancy him a laird of Uist in ancestral
dress, and not like the youth at Oban, a mere masquerader.
We asked the purser who he was.</p>

<p>"Oh, that is Mr. O'Brien, of Liverpool," was his
answer.</p>

<p>Everybody had come up on deck, for the day
was comparatively fine. It kept clearing and
clouding, the sun now shining on the far hills
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>and the rain pouring upon us; but again the
showers were swept landward, and we were in
sunshine. As we neared</p>


<h3>HARRIS,</h3>

<p>a little old lady came bustling up. When the
steamer stopped in the Sound the men in the boats
all touched their bonnets to her, a few even got
on board to speak to her. She was better than
a guide-book, and told the passengers near her all
about Harris. She explained the difficulties of
the channel through the Sound, which, like all
Hebridean waters, is full of islands and rocks hidden
at high tide, and is unprotected by lights. She
pointed out Rodil Church, whose gray tower just
showed above the green hills. She always called
this bit of Harris the Switzerland of the Hebrides,
she said. And with its checker-board-like patches
of green and yellowing grain between the hills and
the water, and lying, while we were there, in sunshine,
it might have looked bright and even happy,
but for the wretched cottages, of which there were
more in this one place than we had seen on all
the journey from Iona.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a name="MOUNTAINS_OF_HARRIS_FROM_TARBET" id="MOUNTAINS_OF_HARRIS_FROM_TARBET"></a><a href="images/illus133a.jpg"><img src="images/illus133.jpg" width="605" height="391" alt="MOUNTAINS OF HARRIS, FROM TARBET." title="" /></a>
</div>
<p class="caption">MOUNTAINS OF HARRIS, FROM TARBET.</p>

<p>Once, as we watched the boats rounding the
steamer's bows, we found ourselves next to this
old lady. She seemed so glad to talk that we
asked her could she perhaps tell us if the people
of Harris were as miserable as their cottages.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh," she said, "their condition is hopeless!"
And then she went on to tell us that she lived
only for Harris, and that there was no one who
knew better than she its poverty. She was, we
learned afterwards, Mrs.&mdash;or Mistress, as Lowlanders
on board called her&mdash;Thomas. Her husband
had been a Government surveyor in the island, and
since his death she had interested herself in the
people, among whom, for many years, she made her
home.</p>

<p>The story of Harris, as she told it and as we
have since read it in the report of the Commission
of 1883, is in the main that of all the Islands and
Highlands. It is the story of men toiling on land
and sea, that by the sweat of their brow they may
make, not their own bread, but the venison and
game of others. Thousands starve that two or
three may have their sport. The land in the
Hebrides is barren, it is argued in behalf of the
sportsmen. Harris is the barrenest of all, Mrs.
Thomas declared. We could see this for ourselves;
after the Switzerland of the Hebrides, the
mountains rose a solid mass of black rock with
scarce a trace of vegetation. But even Harris once
supported its people. That was before they were
made to share the land with the deer. To-day a
few valleys and hill-sides are overcrowded, crofts
divided and subdivided; while others once as green
are now purple with heather, and silent save for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
the guns of sportsmen. Deer forests and large
farms grow larger and larger; crofts shrink, until
from the little patch of ground, long since over-worked,
the crofter can no longer reap even that
which he sows. And yet he sees better land, where
perhaps once grew his potatoes and grain, swallowed
up in the cruel moors. While his harvest
is starvation, deer and grouse live and multiply.</p>

<p>Many villages were cleared when the great deer
forest of Harris was extended, not so many years
ago. The people were turned from homes where
they had always lived, the old with the young, and
women about to become mothers. Highlanders
love their land. Many went back again and again,
even after their cottages were but black piles of
ruin. Because he evicts tenants who will not pay
their rent, the Irish landlord is called cruel. The
evicted in the Hebrides have hitherto been those
who interfere with the landlord's convenience or
amusement. The rent has had nothing to do with
it. And yet of Scotch evictions but comparatively
little has been heard. Journalists skilled in their
trade have published abroad, from one end of the
land to the other, the tale of Irish wrongs. But
who knows the injustice that has been done in
Scotland in order to lay waste broad tracts of good
ground? "I will tell you how Rodil was cleared,"
said John McDiarmid, of Scalpa, to the Commissioners.
"There were one hundred and fifty hearths<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
in Rodil. Forty of these paid rent. When young
Macleod (the landlord) came home with his newly
married wife to Rodil, he went away to show his
wife the place, and twenty of the women of Rodil
came and met them, and danced a reel before them,
so glad were they to see them. By the time the
year was out&mdash;twelve months from that day&mdash;these
twenty women were weeping and wailing, their
houses being unroofed and their fires quenched by
the orders of the estate. I could not say who was
to blame, but before the year was out one hundred
and fifty fires were quenched."</p>

<p>As in Rodil, so it was where now stretches the
deer forest of Harris&mdash;wherever, indeed, deer are
hunted in the Highlands. Whoever wants to
learn the nature of some of the blessings which
come to the many from the proprietary power and
right of the few&mdash;a right and power to which the
Duke of Argyll refers all advance in the Highlands&mdash;let
him read the "History of the Highland
Clearances" as told by Alexander Mackenzie, the
"Gloomy Memories of the Highlands," by Donald
Macleod, himself one of the evicted. Their story
is too cruel for me to tell again. Their country
was desolate; their cities were burned with fire;
their land, strangers devoured it in their presence,
and it was desolate. Never did negro slaves in
the South fare as did the Highland men and women
cleared from the glens and valleys of Suther<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>land. Slaves at least represented so much money;
but the crofter was and <i>is</i> less valuable to the
laird than his sheep and his deer. Slaves could be
sold. This was the one thing which the landlord,
despite all his rights, could not do with his crofters.
He could burn their cottages, starve them and
their families, turn them adrift, and chase them
over seas, there perhaps to meet anew starvation,
disease, and death. From every part of the Highlands
and Islands, from Ross and Argyllshire, as
from Sutherland, hundreds and thousands were
forced to fly, whether they would or not.</p>

<p>And with those who stayed at home, how fared
it? The evicted squatted, we would call it, on the
crofts of friends and relations in other parts of
the estate. There was no place else for them to
go. When there, they sought to solve the bitterest
problem of life&mdash;how to make that which is
but enough for one serve for two&mdash;and therein
were unsuccessful. The landlord washed his hands
of them and their poverty. They had brought it
upon themselves, he reasoned; if crofts were overcrowded,
the fault was theirs. You might as well
force a man into the jungle or swamp reeking with
malaria, and then when he is stricken upbraid him
for living in such a hot-bed of fever. Mr. Alfred
Russel Wallace does not exaggerate when he says,
"For a parallel to this monstrous power of the
land-owner, under which life and property are en<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>tirely at his mercy, we must go back to mediæval,
or to the days when, serfdom not having been
abolished, the Russian noble was armed with despotic
authority, while the more pitiful results of
this landlord tyranny, the wide devastation of cultivated
lands, the heartless burning of houses, the
reckless creation of pauperism and misery out of
well-being and contentment, could only be expected
under the rule of Turkish sultans or
greedy and cruel pashas."</p>

<p>Emigration is the principal remedy suggested.
The landlords of old enforced it, and now, for
very shame, are content to commend it. It is the
remedy most to their taste. It would leave them
alone with their sheep and their game. If the
only Highlanders were the gillies and shepherds,
there would be an end of bothersome tales of
wrongs, rousing the sympathy of the public. The
real reason for emigration is that "any remedies
which might be expected from land law reform
or land acts will be and are likely to be long deferred,
while in the mean time the people are
dying like dogs from starvation." It has been
urged that it would be better if many of the Islanders,
like men of the east coast, became fishermen
altogether and gave up their land. But if
they did, the gain would not be theirs. In many
lochs and bays the people are not allowed to fish
for food because gentlemen must fish for pleasure.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
Few have boats for deep-sea fishing; none have
money to buy them. As it is, in the Long Island
they must compete with well-equipped fishing-smacks
sent into northern seas from Billingsgate
markets.<a name="FNanchor_G" id="FNanchor_G" href="#Footnote_G" class="fnanchor">[G]</a> Not only this, but in both Harris and
Lewis, piers and harbors are few, and fishing-boats
must be light that fishermen may pull them up on
shore beyond reach of the tide. In parts of the
northern Highlands people have been removed
from the glens to the shores in hopes that they
would become fishermen; but they were given no
boats, no harbors.</p>

<p>For Skye and the Long Island, the nearest way
to the main-land is by Strome Ferry, where the
entrance to the harbor is intricate, and so poorly
lighted that once the short winter days set in,
as its passage cannot be attempted after dark,
traffic between the islands and the main-land is
seriously interrupted. But indeed one can but
wonder at the few light-houses on this dangerous
west coast. Here and there one erected on a lonely
rock far out at sea is a triumph of engineering
skill. But the most difficult channels, the wildest
coasts, are left without a light. In the course of
our long journey in Hebridean waters I think we
saw but half a dozen. The life-boat institution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
in British islands is now supported by charity.
It seems as if the light-house service as well must
fall to the benevolence of advertisers and city corporations.</p>

<p>It is well to say what the people ought to do;
it is better to explain what they cannot do. They
are hampered and held back on every side, and
then the stranger is told that he need not pity them,
they are so lazy. They are thriftless and good-for-nothing,
Lowlanders on the steamer assured us.
When you first go among them you believe in
their laziness. Their little patches of potatoes
and grain are full of weeds, and their ditches are
choked; broken windows are mended with rags
or heather, dirt and rubbish lie waiting to be
cleared away. From their doors they step into
the mud. A very little industry is needed to set
these things right. You wonder if, after all, it
may not be their own fault that they are so poor.
But this is what a doctor of Raasay told the Commissioners,
"The prevailing disease is poverty, and
the chief remedy is food." The people have not
enough to eat; that is why they do not work hard.
You have but to look into their faces to know that
they are starving. Hardly a winter passes that
food has not to be begged for them. Even as I
write, petitions come from a school-master in Lewis.
Unless money and meal are sent to them, the people
in his district cannot live through the winter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
But until two years ago had they not been from
morning to night, from night to morning, weak
from hunger; if fields had been made to yield a
richer harvest; if crofts and houses had been kept
neat and pretty, the profit would have been the
landlords'. The greater the people's industry, the
higher the rent they paid. If they made improvements,
the rent was raised. Nor did they
know at what moment the fruits of their labor
might be swept away. The landlord had but to
say, "I want my land, you must go," and their
work of years had come to naught. No matter
how long the crofter lived in the cottage where
dwelt his father and grandfather before him, the
day never came when he could say of a surety,
"To-morrow this roof will be over my head, these
fields and pastures will be mine to care for."</p>

<p>In the Hebrides, the landlord has always had
rights; the crofter, until the passing of the Crofters'
Bill of 1886, had none. I remember that on
that day on the boat, with the shores of hopeless
Harris in sight, Mrs. Thomas said to me, "There
are two sides to the question, of course. The
landlord has a right to do as he chooses with his
own land." This is the argument of the landlords.
They can quote Scripture in its support. "A
man may do as he likes with his own," an Irish
land-owner reminded his tenants the other day
when he threatened to sweep them off the face of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
his estates. It is an old, well-worn argument; to
answer it French revolutions and American civil
wars have been fought. Englishmen have been
ever ready to dispute it abroad; at home they are
its advocates.</p>

<p>Probably we ought to have seen this other side;
I admit that it would have been far pleasanter. A
few letters of introduction&mdash;at that time, at any
rate, not impossible to obtain&mdash;would have opened
the doors of many of the big houses on our route,
would have furnished J&mdash;&mdash; with a gun and me with
days of boredom, would have introduced us to the
natives in another fashion; for, according to all
accounts, they would then have greeted us as if
they were slaves, and not the most fearless and
independent people in Great Britain. Of course
we understand that strangers in the islands who
do see this side of island life, find it as delightful
as strangers in the South at home once found that
of the old Southern gentleman. But we defy any
one who visits the islands after our manner, not
to be filled as we were with the thought of the
people's misery; for the bondage in which they
are held to-day is more cruel than was that of
slaves in the slave States of America or of serfs in
Russia.</p>

<p class="caption">GATHERING PEAT.</p>

<p>There are good landlords in the Highlands, just
as there were bad slave-owners in the South&mdash;men
who give the half-starved, half-frozen crofter the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>blankets and meal which, if he were emancipated,
he could provide for himself; for the crofter is
no better, but indeed worse than a slave, since he
must bear the burdens both of freedom and of
slavery. He is free to pay more for land than it
is worth, to be taxed for roads which are never
built, and for schools where his language is scorned,
and, in some islands, his religion dishonored; and,
moreover, in proportion to his means, to be taxed
more heavily than men in any other part of Scotland;
in some districts he is free to cut from the
moorland peat for fuel, to gather from the shore
sea-weed for manure, to take from waste lands
heather or grass to thatch his roof, only if he pays
for the privilege. Here his freedom ends. In his
house&mdash;the Englishman's castle&mdash;he is so little his
own master that he cannot keep a sheep or a pig
or a dog, unless it be the will of his laird. If he
asks to lay his grievances before the factor he is
called a rebel, and warned not to dare speak in
such fashion; and this by a landlord praised by
the great world because of the winter distribution
of blankets and meal. If his complaints should
be listened to, there is little chance of redress from
men who value rabbits and grouse more highly than
they do their tenants. He is wholly at the mercy of
the factor, who usually holds all the highest offices
on the estate, and has the power, as at Barra, to disenfranchise
an entire island. This is the account<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
of his position given by a minister in Skye: "The
crofter has no protection from the large tacksmen;
if he makes a complaint he can get no redress.
There is no law in Skye. Might is the only right,
and that, too, in the last decade of the nineteenth
century. One great evil which sadly needs reform
is the state of terrorism under which the small
tenantry live through the insolent threats of subordinate
officials, whose impudence increases in
proportion to the smallness of their authority."
It was time, indeed, when the Royal Commission
was sent to the Highlands; and yet, though the
Commission has reduced rents and cancelled arrears,
it has not struck at the root of the evil&mdash;the
existing relations between landlord and crofter.</p>

<p>The crofter's representative in Parliament is
often, fortunately not always, a stranger who comes
just before or after his election&mdash;as a candidate
for Skye came to that island while we were there&mdash;and
tells the people he has never been there before,
they do not know him as yet, but he hopes
they may later; and then he steams away in his
yacht. Whether elected or not, we may feel sure
he will never come again. But what is to be hoped
for from Parliament? "They are all landlords in
the House of Commons: what will they do for us?"
the crofters and cotters of Lewis asked the other
day. That is why they are taking matters into
their own hands. They know there is no one else<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
to help them. In a body they marched upon deer
forest and sheep farm, and scattered over the island
or drove into the sea sheep and deer. When
there were no more sheep and deer, the landlord
would be glad enough to give them back land
which in days of old was green with their crops.
And now, in further proof of the justice done to
crofters, the leaders of these raids await trial in
Edinburgh, to which town they cannot afford to
bring their witnesses, and where no lawyers of note
will defend them.<a name="FNanchor_H" id="FNanchor_H" href="#Footnote_H" class="fnanchor">[H]</a></p>

<p>The crofter is a slave not only to landlord and
factor, but often to the merchant. The Englishman,
when he finds the truck system far from
home, cannot too strongly revile it. A report has
but come from Newfoundland declaring that because
of it a Newfoundlander is no more master
of his own destiny than was a mediæval serf or a
Southern negro in 1860. The writer need not
have gone 1600 miles to the colonies to expose
an evil which exists in the British Isles but 600
miles from London.<a name="FNanchor_I" id="FNanchor_I" href="#Footnote_I" class="fnanchor">[I]</a> The Duke of Argyll regrets
that it is employed in Tiree. His power as proprietor,
the one power for good on his estates,
stops short most unaccountably where other people
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>might think it could be exercised to best advantage.
Many Western Islanders, like Newfoundlanders,
are bound hand and foot to the merchant.
The latter provides them on credit with all the
necessaries of life, often the poorest in quality, but
always the highest in price. In return the crofter's
earnings, before he has gained them, belong to
the merchant, who, moreover, is at times his employer
as well as his creditor. In Harris the women
support their families by weaving the famous
Harris cloth. To Edinburgh and London tailors
it brings good profit; to them, starvation wages,
paid in tea or sugar or meal. No money is in circulation
on the island. Harris people have given
their consent to emigrate, and then at the last moment
have been kept prisoners at home because of
a debt of years against them.</p>

<p>As we lay by the island of Scalpa, not far from
Tarbert, a man came on board from one of the
boats. He had a roll of cloth under his arm.
He gave it to Mrs. Thomas, and asked if some
one on board would buy it. As we looked at
it he said nothing, but the pitiful pleading of his
eyes, and their more pitiful disappointment as he
turned away with his cloth, told the story. She
tried to dispose of their cloth for them, Mrs.
Thomas said; and we have since heard that she
buys more from them than even the local merchant.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<h3>TARBERT.</h3>

<p>The principal building in the village was the large
white manse, half hidden in trees. A parson's first
care, even if he went to the Cannibal Islands, would
be, I fancy, to make himself, or have made for him
at somebody else's expense, a comfortable home.
There were also on the outskirts of the village two
or three new, well-built cottages for men in Lady
Scott's, the landlord's, direct service, and a large,
excellent hotel, the only place in Tarbert where
spirits could be bought. The rich may have their
vices, though the poor cannot. Beyond was misery.
Wherever we went in the island we found a
rocky wilderness, the mountains black as I have
never seen them anywhere else, their tops so bare
of even soil that in the sunlight they glistened as
if ice-bound. Here and there, around the lochs
and sloping with the lower rocky hills, were weed-choked
patches of grain and huts wreathed in
smoke, their backs turned hopelessly to the road.
Near Tarbert there was one burrowed out like a
rabbit-hole, its thatched roof set upon the grass
and weeds of the hill-side. Just below, in the
loch, Lady Scott's steam-yacht came and went.
Beyond, her deer forest, a range of black mountains,
stretched for miles. Within sight and low
on the water were the thick woods, in the heart of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
which stands her shooting-lodge. The contrast
gave the last bitter touch to the condition of the
people. They starve on tiny crofts, their only
homes; their landlord holds broad acres as play-ground
for a few short weeks.</p>

<p>The hovels were as cheerless within as without.
I do not know why it is that one takes liberties with
the poor which one would not dare take with the
rich. It is no small evil of poverty that it is everybody's
privilege to stare at it. The people of
Harris are hospitable, and receive the stranger with
courtesy, but you can see that they resent the intrusion.
It is not, I fear, to our credit that curiosity
got the better of our scruples. We knocked at
a cottage door, one Sunday afternoon, J&mdash;&mdash;, as an
excuse, asking for a light. As we drew near we
heard the voice of some one reading aloud. Now it
was silenced, and a tall old man in his shirt-sleeves
came to the door with an open Bible in his hands.
Within, on the left, was the dwelling-room of the
household; on the right, the stable, cattle, and family
share the only entrance. Into the room, through
a single pane of glass, one ray of daylight fell across
the Rembrandt-like shadows. On the mud floor,
at the far end, a fire of peat burned with a dull red
glow, and its thick, choking smoke curled in clouds
about the rafters and softened the shadows. We
could just make out the figures of two women
crouching by the fire, the curtained bed in the corner,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
the spinning-wheel opposite. All other details
were lost in gloom and smoke. Until you see
it for yourself, you could not believe that in our
nineteenth century men still live like this. Miss
Gordon Cumming says that to the spinning and
weaving of the women "is due much of such comfort
as we may see by a peep into some of their
little homes." But our peep showed us only that
women weave and men work in vain, and that to
speak of comfort is mockery in a cottage of Harris,
or, indeed, in any cottage we saw in any part of the
islands, for all those we went into were alike in
their poverty and their darkness. As a rule, the
fire burned in the centre on a circle of stones,
and over it, from the roof, hung chain and hook
for the kettle. They have not changed one jot or
tittle since, a century ago, they moved Pennant to
pity.</p>

</div>
<p class="caption">INTERIOR OF A WEAVER&#39;S COTTAGE.</p>

<p>As we left the hut on the hill-side, the first we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
visited, "I beg pardon," said the old crofter, who
had not understood J&mdash;&mdash;'s thanks. His words
seemed a reproach. We felt that we should be
begging his pardon. To force our way in upon
him in his degradation was to add one more to the
many insults he has had to bear. He stood at the
door a minute, and then went back into the gloom
of the low room, with its mud floor and smoky
rafters, which he calls his home.</p>

<p>All day long, even when the sun shone, as it did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
at intervals during our stay, Harris was a land of
sorrow and desolation, but in the evening it became
a land of beauty. The black rock of the
mountain-side softened into purple shadows against
the gold of sky and sea, and in this glory the
hovels and the people and the misery disappeared.
And when the sun sank behind the western waters
and the gold faded, there fell a great peace over
the island, and with it began the twilight, that
lingered until it grew into the coming day.</p>

<p>It was on Sunday mornings that there was greatest
stir in Tarbert. Then the people came from
far and near to meet in the little kirk overlooking
the loch. We were told that comparatively few
were at home. This was the season when they go
to the east coast, the men to the fishing, the women
to the curing-houses; but we thought they came
in goodly numbers as we watched them winding
with the road down the opposite hill-side, and
scrambling over the rocks behind the town. Boats
one by one sailed into the loch and to the pier,
bringing with them old women in clean white caps
and tartan shawls, younger women in feathered
hats and overskirts, men in bonnets and blue sailor-cloth.
They were a fine-looking set of people,
here and there among them a face beautiful with
the rich, dark beauty of the South&mdash;all that is left
of the Armada. As they came up upon the pier
they stopped in groups under the shelter of a boat-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>house, for the wind was high, the men to comb
their beards and hair, the women to tie one another's
bonnet-strings and scarfs, to smooth one
another's shawls. And all the time scarce a word
was spoken; they were as solemn at their toilet as
if already they stood in church.</p>

<p>The Islanders are as melancholy as the wilderness
in which they live. The stranger among them
never gets used to their perpetual silence. Their
troubles have made them turn from the amusements
they once loved. The pipes now seldom
are heard in the Hebrides. Their one consolation,
their one resource, is religion, and to them religion
is a tragedy. Nowhere was the great conflict in
the Church of Scotland fought with such intensity,
such passion, as in Skye. That same Sunday in
Harris, we met the people coming home over the
hills, and still they walked each alone, and all in
unbroken silence. And this Sabbath stillness lasts
throughout the week.</p>

<p>It is not only in Mr. Black's novels you meet
kings in the Lews. From out of the boats laden
with worshippers there stepped the King of Scalpa.
He is a Campbell, we were told; and what is more,
if he had his rights it is he who would bear
the Argyll titles, enjoy the Argyll wealth, instead
of the Campbell who calls himself Duke and
writes books in the castle at Inverary. His story
is the usual romance of the Highlands: a murder,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
a flight, the succession of the younger brother to
titles and estates, the descendants of the murderer,
exiles in a far island. And so it is that the real
Duke of Argyll is but a merchant in Scalpa. However,
if the so-called Duke had nothing more serious
to fear than the pretensions of the King of
Scalpa, he might rest at ease. It is his right not
to a name, but to the privilege to do with his own
as he likes, that he must needs defend. He can
afford to ignore the Campbells of the Outer Hebrides;
but let him fight with his deadliest weapons
against the crofters who to-day pay him rent. All
the arguments he has set forth in "Scotland as it
Was, and Scotland as it Is," in themselves are not
enough to avert the day of reckoning which even
to him, apparently, seems so near at hand.</p>

<p>We left Harris, as we came to it, in the <i>Dunara
Castle</i>, and dropped anchor in the Bay of Uig, in</p>


<h3>SKYE,</h3>

<p>one morning while the day was still young. The
shores were circled about with patches of grain
and potatoes and many cottages; and Skye, as we
first saw it, seemed fair and fertile after the rocks
of Harris. Its people are little better off, however.
It was here, about Uig, on the estates of
Captain Fraser, that crofters rebelled in 1884 as
those of Lewis are rebelling to-day. Their rents
in many cases have been reduced, their arrears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
cancelled. But landlords as they exist, or crofters,
must go before there can be more than negative
improvement in the islands.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a name="DOING_SKYE" id="DOING_SKYE"></a><a href="images/illus161a.jpg"><img src="images/illus161.jpg" width="516" height="440" alt="DOING SKYE." title="" /></a>
</div>
<p class="caption">DOING SKYE.</p>

<p>When we were rowed to the shore the landlord
of the Uig Inn stood posing as modern warden of
the brand-new round tower on the hill-top. He
took our knapsacks, and set us on the way to the
Quiraing.</p>

<p>A steep climb up a wooded corrie brought us
to the moors, the long purple distances unbroken
save for the black lines marking where the peat had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
been cut, and the black mounds where the cuttings
had been piled at intervals along the road. Once
we passed men and women loading a cart with
them. Once we saw a rude shepherd's hut, on a little
hillock, surrounded by sheep. And in the long
walk, that was all! When we started across the
moorland the sun shone and the morning was hot.
When suddenly the moorland came to an end and
gave way to the tall jagged rocks of the Quiraing,
the sky was all gray and the mist fell fast behind
us. We left the road for a foot-path, and at once
lost our way. We scrambled over rocks, slipped
up and down soft spongy hills, jumped streams, and
skirted lochs, J&mdash;&mdash; stopping in the most impossible
places to make notes. We were now ankle-deep
in mud, now knee-high in wet grass and heather.
The guide-book says the Quiraing cannot be described;
I am sure I cannot describe it, for the
simple reason that I did not see it. At first I was
too much taken up in trying not to kill myself;
when the climbing was a little less dangerous and
I looked about me, there was nothing to be seen.
The mist had hidden the top of the rocks and was
rolling down fast towards us. J&mdash;&mdash; was very anxiously
looking at the guide-book and at the sea.
Suddenly he seized me and pulled me, panting,
behind him, over bowlders, through bracken, down
a hill as steep as a house, in our hurry starting
avalanches of stones. Then he jumped into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
bed of a stream, down which we rushed, up to our
knees in water, to the loch at the bottom. It was
a mad flight. But by this time we could not see
our hands before us.</p>

<p>"I am half dead," said I.</p>

<p>"If you don't come on we'll both be dead," said
J&mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>And just then, more by good luck than good
management, we found ourselves on a road.</p>

<p>J&mdash;&mdash; had studied the lay of the land before our
start. He knew this must be the road by the
coast, twice as long on its way to Uig as that
over which we had come; but there was no finding
our way back in the mist. It fell from above,
it rose from the ground, it closed about us on all
sides. In a few minutes cloaks and hoods were
soaked. We tried to be as indifferent as the
Highlomaniac who pretends he likes this sort of
thing. We sat on a stone by the way-side to eat
the few sandwiches we had brought with us, and
declared it an excellent joke. We walked across
a dripping field as calmly as if it had been dry
land, so that we might not come face to face with
a monstrous bull which kept our path. And when
the road came out close to the sea, and the mist
turned into a driving rain, J&mdash;&mdash; even pulled out
his guide-book and on its back made mysterious
scrawls, which he said represented Duntulm Castle,
a gray ruin on a high cliff, looking seaward.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>There were by the road many groups of huts
black, soaked, chimneyless; always near them a
large manse and sometimes a larger school-house,
which the people must maintain if they starve for
it. Women with hunger on their faces looked
after us. Children with old brown bags tied about
their waists for all clothing stood at the doors to
watch, but not one smiled at the sight. And yet
we must have been funny! And the villages were
silent as the moorland. There was not a voice to
be heard. The women to whom we spoke shook
their heads; "No English," was their only answer.
The one person we found who could talk it was a
man, and he had so many gutturals we could scarce
understand him.</p>

<p>Near Duntulm Castle was a shooting-lodge; on
the water a steam-yacht lay at anchor. The slave-driver
is found for at least six weeks in the midst
of his slaves.</p>

<p>We arrived at the inn about three in the afternoon,
drenched and weary. A room was ready for
us, a bright fire burning on the hearth. They
always expected people to come home wet, the
landlord's daughter said. She carried off our wet
clothes; she lent me a dress; she brought us hot
whiskey and water. One must be thoroughly tired
to know what comfort means.</p>

<p>We had our tea with two English maiden ladies
of the species one meets in Swiss and Italian pen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>sions.
We sat in a well-warmed room at a well-spread
table. In the black, smoky huts half-starved
men, women, and children were eating dry oatmeal;
a few, perhaps, drinking tea with it. This is the
extravagance with which the crofters have been reproached.
They buy, or rather go into debt for,
tea and sugar as well as meal, and therefore their
landlords think them prosperous. They have never
been so well off before, the Commissioners were
told; once they lived on shell-fish throughout the
summer. Yes, it was true, a minister of Snizort
admitted, they did drink tea. But the people have
no milk, now pasture-land has been taken from
them. The landlord needed it for his large sheep
farms and deer forests. I suppose they should go
back to the shell-fish as of old. If they have
food to eat, why complain of its quality? If this
be so, if crofters of to-day, compared to their ancestors,
live in luxury, then has the time indeed
come when something should be done for them.
Who will call them lazy or indifferent who has
considered what the life of the Islander has been
for generations? The wonder is that he has energy
enough to keep on living.</p>

<p>We went the next day to</p>


<h3>DUNVEGAN.</h3>

<p>The road lay over long miles of moors, with now
and then beautiful distant views of the mountains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
of Harris, but pale blue shadows oil the western
horizon, and of the high peaks of the Cuchullins,
dark and sombre above the moorland.</p>

<p>Here and there at long intervals we came to the
wretched groups of cottages we had begun to know
so well. Old witch-like women and young girls
passed, bent double under loads of peat or sea-weed,
so heavy that were the same thing seen in
Italy, English people would long since have filled
columns of the <i>Times</i> with their sympathy. As it
is, these burdens are accepted as a matter of course,
or sometimes even as but one of the many picturesque
elements of Highland life. From one writer
one hears of the Skye lassies, half hidden under
bundles of heather, stopping to laugh and chatter;
from another of Lewis women knitting contentedly
as they walked along with creels, bearing burdens
that would have appalled a railway porter of
the south, strapped to their backs. We saw no
smiles, no signs of contentment. On the faces of
the strongest women there was a look of weariness
and of pain. But perhaps the most pathetic faces
in this land of sorrow were those of the children,
already pinched and care-worn. I know others who
have felt this even as we did. An Englishman
who last summer spent a week in Skye has since
told us how day after day he and his wife went
upon their excursions lunchless, because in the
first village to which they came they emptied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
their luncheon-basket among the half-naked, half-starved
children they found there. They could not
bear the sight of the hungry little faces. But even
in his sympathy, the general poverty seemed to
him only right, he said, since it is in such perfect
harmony with the dismal, dreary land in which the
people live. If they were happy, however, if moors
and hills were green with their crops, would it still
seem so dismal?</p>

<p>That day and those which had preceded and those
which followed we went into many huts, talked to
many people. We became bold because we wished
to learn for ourselves the truth of what we had
heard, and not to be prejudiced by hearsay. The
crofter's hut is felt to be a disgrace to the Highlands.
The landlord shifts all responsibility. The
crofter alone is at fault; he has no shame in living
in his hovel, which is scarcely fit to shelter a dog.
This is the favorite argument. How the crofter,
without money, without other materials than those
at his disposal, could build anything better has not
as yet been explained. If, however, he does contrive
to make it better, his rent is raised, and he might,
until within two years, have been turned out on
the morrow. If he moves into a house set up by
a landlord there is again question of higher rent,
though he may find it has been put up so cheaply
that cold winds pour through cracks and crannies,
heavy rains soak through roof and walls. In his
own black hut, if he lives with his cattle he can
at least keep warm. His contentment in his
degradation is a myth. To many cottages we
were absolutely refused admittance. Ours was
not the experience of Miss Gordon Cumming.
Whenever we approached a cottage, a kindly voice
did not bid us welcome. I remember one in particular
where the door was shut against us. Of a
woman of the village who could speak English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>&mdash;and it must be borne in mind that with few rare
exceptions people in the Hebrides speak but Gaelic&mdash;and
who had already shown us her smoky, dismal
home, we asked that we might be let in to see the
old loom. No, was the first answer sent out; its
owner will not be dressed. No, was the second;
the loom will not be working. No, was the third and
final; "we wass just pretending about the loom; it
wass the house we wanted to see." In another,
though the woman drew up chairs by the peat
smouldering and smoking in the middle of the floor,
there was no mistaking she looked upon us as intruders.
She shook her head and said without a
smile, "No English," when we spoke to her; and
then she turned her back and began to comb her
hair. A bright, fresh-looking girl who rowed us over
the water near Kingsburgh House received us more
amiably. It was the usual interior, thick with smoke,
all details lost in black shadow, though without the
sun was shining. "You will find our houses very
queer places to live in," she said. And as she ferried
us across, every few minutes she turned and
asked if we didn't find their cottages queer homes.</p>

<p>Nothing is left of Flora Macdonald's house
which has made Kingsburgh famous. But our
ferry-woman pointed to a clump of trees on the
shores of the loch where it once stood. "Flora
Macdonald was a good friend of the people," she
said; "she was a strong woman and clever, and she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
helped to hide Prince Charlie from those who
were in search of him, and for that reason she will
be loved and remembered."</p>

<p>Strange as it may seem, these were her words.
They so struck us at the time that I wrote them
down once we were on shore again. I have heard
people wonder at the intelligence Italian peasants
show in expressing themselves; but it is not more
striking than that of Western Islanders. When
they could speak English, it always made us marvel.
No one can read the report of their evidence
before the Royal Commission without marvelling
with us.</p>

<p>It was not only in Skye we talked to the people;
already in Harris we had much to say to those
who had the English. The very fact that we
were walking, a great part of the time with packs
on our backs, made the people meet us on more
friendly terms than if we drove in coaches or sailed
in yachts. We were strangers, it was evident;
but we were not sportsmen or moneyed tourists.
On every side we heard the same story of hated
landlords and exhausted crofts. We know that
what we say can have but little influence for good
or evil. And yet when we remember the sad
stories to which we listened, and the cruel lot of
those who told them, we would not run the smallest
risk of making that lot still more cruel, those
stories still more sad. There is ill-feeling enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
between Hebridean landlords and their slaves. In
three cases at least crofters were turned from their
crofts because they gave evidence to the Commissioners
of 1883. It is well to be on the safe side.
The chances are, not a landlord will know that we
have been writing about his estates after walking
over them; but we think it best to give no clew
to the identity of men who told us in a friendly
way that which already had been proclaimed officially.</p>

<p>The chief complaint was the same wherever we
went: "We have not enough land; we could and
would pay rent willingly if we had more ground to
cultivate. As it is, our crofts are not large enough
to keep us in food." The outside world has been
busy watching the battle in Ireland; little attention
has been spared to the Highlands; yet every
small paragraph on the subject for which newspapers
can make room, between accounts of stolen
breeches and besieged members of Parliament,
shows the determination of the men who are fighting
the same battle in the far north. If troops are
kept in Ireland, if Welsh tithes can only be collected
by hussars, war-ships are sent to the Islands.
If Irishmen, protected by a Land League, refuse to
pay rent, so do Scotch crofters. Indeed, the latter
are far more determined and daring. They know,
too, how to hold together. In Glendale, an out-of-the-way
corner of Skye to which strangers seldom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
penetrate, not a crofter has paid rent for five years.
An old man, tenant on another estate, told us about
them with pride. "No, sir," he said, "they have
no paid a penny for five years, but the factor he
will keep friends with them. He will know ferry
well if he wass not their friend it will be worse
trouble that will be coming whatever."</p>

<p>He was a fine, healthy old man, between sixty
and seventy; and when he found that we sympathized,
he walked about half a mile just to talk
with us. He pretended he came to show us the
way, but as the road was straight before us it was
easy to see through his excuse.</p>

<p>J&mdash;&mdash; asked him what he thought about the crofter
question. "I will be a real old Land Leaguer
every time," he declared; and then he went on to
tell us that in his part of the island the crofters
held together like one man. The Commission was
coming; it was slow, but they would wait for it.
Then, if it did not improve their condition, they
would take matters into their own hands. Their
landlord was good enough, as landlords went; he
was a civil-spoken gentleman if rents were paid on
the very day they were due, but that was about all
that could be said for him. Rents were not so
high on his estate as on others, but the taxes were
heavy, and it was more land they needed. "You
will see those potatoes"&mdash;and he pointed to a tiny
green patch sloping down from the road to a ditch,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
beyond which was heather&mdash;"you will see for yourself
they grow well whatever. And they would be
growing as well on the other side of the ditch,
where I myself have planted them in other days.
But what will grow there now? Heather and
ferns! And it will be heather and ferns you will
see as far as you can for twelve miles. If they
will be giving us more land, sir, it's no trouble
from the Highlanders they will be having; but if
they don't give it to us we will take it."</p>

<p class="caption">DUNVEGAN CASTLE.</p>

<p>He shook hands heartily with us both when he
left. One may doubt the demagogue who uses the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
people's suffering for political capital; but one can
but respect a man like this sturdy old crofter, himself
one of the people, who knows his wrongs and
determines to right them. His methods may be
illegal; so have been those of many men who
have struggled for freedom.</p>

<p>At Dunvegan Inn we were again in civilized society.
We dined with two young men from London
who were followed even here by the <i>Saturday
Review</i> and the <i>Standard</i>. They took interest in
the evicted Irish, and ignored the existence of
Highland crofters; they could tell us much of the
fish, but nothing of the fishermen. They were
anxious to direct us to many howling wildernesses
within an easy walk of the dinner-table, where we
could escape from the people; and when the people,
in the shape of two Aberdeen farmers, full of
the crofter's wrongs, appeared at breakfast, they
went from the room in disgust. I think this disgust
would have been greater had they known how
much more interesting we found the farmers.</p>

<p>Beyond the inn the road led through a dense
wood to the castle of the Macleod of Macleod.
Trees will not grow on Hebridean soil until the
laird wishes to raise them for himself; then they
thrive well enough. Of course we did not expect
to find them growing on northern exposed shores;
but surely there must be other sheltered spots besides
those directly around the laird's house. How<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>ever, it is the same with his crops; broad acres
are covered by his grain and that of his large tenants;
his pasture-land is fresh and green. It is a
strange fact that only when the crofter asks to cultivate
the land does it become absolutely barren.
It is but a step from the wild, lonely moorland to
the beautiful green wood at Dunvegan. Landward
it shuts in the castle, whose turreted keep rises
high above the ivy-grown battlemented walls,
crowning a rocky island in a sheltered corner of
the loch. The water has been drained from the
natural moat, but the rock falls sheer and steep
from the castle gate, and the drawbridge still crosses
the gulf below. We did not go inside; we were
told that the present wife of the Macleod objected
to visitors, even though she admitted them. We
believe there are tapestries and old armor and the
usual adjuncts to be seen for the asking, such things
as one can find in any museum; but it is only by
going to the islands that you can see the crofters'
wrongs.</p>

<p>Almost at the end of the woods, and yet sheltered
by them, was a <ins title="Transcriber's Note: inserted a comma here">pretty,</ins> old-fashioned flower-garden,
surrounded by well-clipped hedges, and as
well cared for as the garden of an English castle.
Nearer to the inn, on a low hill, was the graveyard
of the Macleod. We pushed open the tumble-down
gate and squeezed through. A hundred
years ago Dr. Johnson found fault with the bad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
English on Lord Lovat's tomb; to-day we could
hardly find the tomb. The stone on which the inscription
was carved lay in pieces on the ground.
It may be that the Macleod of Macleod has bankrupted
himself to save his tenants from starvation.
This is most praiseworthy on his part. But we
could not help thinking that if he and all the Macleods,
from one end of Great Britain to the other,
are so anxious to be buried here, they might among
them find money enough to free the enclosure of
their dead from the whiskey bottles and sandwich
tins left by the tourist. The resting-place of the
dead Macleod lies desolate; not far off is the gar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>den, with smooth lawn and many blossoms. A few
flowers less, perhaps, and at least the bottles and
tins that defile what should be a holy place, could
be cleared away. And this graveyard, with its
broken tombs and roofless chapel, is a ruin of yesterday.
A century ago Dr. Johnson saw it still
cared for and in order. The people in Dunvegan
told us that twenty years since the roof fell in; it
has never been repaired. We have been to the
graveyard of old St. Pancras in London, where
every few minutes trains rush above the desecrated
graves; but here the dead are unknown, or
else, like Mary Wolstonecraft and Godwin, their
tombs have been removed beyond the reach of
modern improvements. We have been to the
Protestant burying-ground in the cemetery of old
St. Louis in New Orleans, neglected because those
who lie there belong to the despised faith. And
yet neither of these is dishonored as is the graveyard
where sleep the Macleods of the far and near
past, whose greatness the living Macleods never
cease to sing. Beneath the weeds are old gray
slabs, with carvings like those of Iona; in the ruined
weed-grown chapel walls are fresh white marble
tablets. At Dunvegan the dead are not forgotten,
not despised; they are only neglected.
The mower comes and cuts the long grass from
above their trampled graves. Let the laird make
hay while the sun shines, for the day is coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
when the storms, forever brooding over the Isle
of Mists, will break forth with a violence he has
never felt before, and he and his kind will be
swept away from off the face of the land.</p>

<p class="caption">GRAVEYARD OF THE MACLEOD.</p>

<p>To-day Macleod of Macleod is a poor man. One
year of famine, to keep the crofters from starving,
he emptied his own purse. It is but another proof
of the uselessness of charity in the Hebrides. What
did it profit the crofters that Macleod became for
their sake a bankrupt? They still starve. He
who would really help them must be not only
their benefactor, but their emancipator.</p>

<p>From Dunvegan to</p>


<h3>STRUAN</h3>

<p>it was all moorland. The shadeless road ran for
miles between the heather, from which now and
again, as we passed, rose the startled grouse. Far
in front were the Cuchullins, only their high,
jagged peaks showing above the clouds that hung
heavy about them. The little Struan inn, which
we had to ourselves, was low down by the water,
at the foot of a wide hill-side planted with turnips.
On the brow of the hill, like so many bowlders in
the mud, were strewn the huts of a miserable village.
Manse and kirk were at a becoming distance
across the road.</p>

<p>Though this was after the 12th of August, when
the Wilderness of Skye is supposed to be of some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
use, we saw in miles of moorland one man fishing,
and a second shooting; for the latter a carriage
waited on the road below. In order that these
two, and perhaps half a dozen more like them,
should have a fortnight's amusement, the land
from Dunvegan to Sligachan has been cleared of
its inhabitants. On the high-road between these
two places&mdash;a distance of about twenty-two or
twenty-three miles&mdash;there are not above a dozen
huts, and only one or two decent houses. It is
true, there is a large and flourishing distillery.</p>

<p>After Struan we were still on the moors. The
only breaks in the monotony were the showers,
the mile-stones, and the water-falls. The mountains,
upon which we had counted for the beauty
of the walk, were now completely lost in the
clouds. Not until we were within two miles of
Sligachan did the thick veil before them roll
slowly up, showing us peaks rising beyond peaks,
rugged hollows, and deep precipices. But it fell
again almost at once, and for the rest of the way
we saw but one high mountain coming out and
being swallowed up again in the mist and clouds.</p>

<p>Near the inn, and a hundred yards or so from
the road, was a reedy pool. A man stood in the
water, a woman on the shore, both silently fishing
in the rain. It is in duck-puddles like this&mdash;in
which, were they at home, an American boy would
sail his boat or throw his line to his heart's content<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>&mdash;that guests in Highland inns, by special kindness
of the landlord, are allowed to fish, this permission
being advertised as a leading attraction of
the inn.</p>

<p>We intended to stay a day or two in</p>


<h3>SLIGACHAN.</h3>

<p>We wanted to see the Cuchullins and the much-talked-about
Loch Coruisk. But here we found
that we were again on the tourist route from which
we had gone so far astray. There was not a room
to be had in the inn. It was full of immaculately
dressed young ladies and young Oxford men, all
with their knickerbockers at the same degree of
bagginess, their stockings turned down at the same
angle. We might have thought that the landlady
objected to tramps when the company was so elegant,
had she not offered to put us up in the drawing-room
and found places for us at the <i>table-d'hôte</i>
luncheon. The talk was all of hotels and lochs
and glens and travels. How long have you been
in Skye? Is this your first visit? Did you come
by Loch Maree? At what hotel did you stay in
Oban? But there was not a word about cottages;
for there is nothing in Sligachan, or near it, as far
as we could see, but this swell hotel, which seemed
very good.</p>

<p>Beds in the drawing-room meant to be at the
mercy of the company. We did not hesitate.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
And still the moors stretched out before us. No
one who has not tramped in Skye can imagine its
dreariness. In Portree, a miniature Oban, we lost
all courage. We might have gone back to Loch
Coruisk. We might have tramped to take a
nearer view of the Old Man of Storr, which we
had already seen in the distance. We might
have walked to Armadale, or steamed to Strome
Ferry. There were, in fact, many things we
could and should have done; but we had seen
enough of the miserable life in the islands&mdash;those
great deserts, with but here and there a lovely
oasis for the man of wealth. Our walks had
been long; we were tired physically and sick mentally.</p>

<p>And so, early one morning, we took the boat at
Portree and steamed back to the main-land; past
Raasay, where Dr. Johnson stayed, and where there
was a big house with beautiful green lawn and fine
woods; past Glenelg, where we should have landed
to follow the Doctor's route, but the prospect of a
thirty miles' walk to reach the nearest inn made
cowards of us; past Armadale, now as when Pennant
saw it, "a seat, beautifully wooded, gracing
most unexpectedly this almost treeless tract;"
past one island of hills after another; and thus
into the Sound of Mull, to get a glimpse of Tobermory
in sunshine. It was a lovely day; sea and
sky and far islands blue, the water like glass;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
though, before it had come to an end, we had
twice fled to the cabin from heavy showers.
There were many sight-seers on board, and we
could but wonder why. The women read novels,
the men went to sleep. But they had done their
duty&mdash;they had been to Scotland for the holidays;
they had probably seen the Quiraing and
Dunvegan. But they had not gone our way. The
coach roads are those from which the least misery
is visible.</p>

<p>That evening Oban did its best for us. The
sun went down in red fire beyond Mull's now purpling
hills. And as the burning after-glow cooled
into the quiet twilight, we looked for the last time
on the island of Mull. It seemed in its new beauty
to have found peace and rest. May this seeming
have become reality before we again set foot
on Hebridean shores!</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;The Crofters' Act of 1886 was supposed to do
away with the crofters' wrongs. As yet it has accomplished
little. In some cases the Commissioners appointed for the
purpose have lowered the extortionate rents which crofters
have been starving for years to pay. Now that agitation in
the islands has made it absolutely necessary that something
should be done for the people, in one or two test cases, those
clauses of the act which prevent landlords evicting tenants
at their own pleasure have been enforced. Beyond this the
condition of the people is absolutely no better than it was
before the act was passed. They have not enough land to
support them, and when they appeal for more, their landlord
answers, as Lady Matheson has just answered her
small tenants in the Lewis, "The land is mine; you have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
nothing to do with it." Nothing has been done for the cotters
who have no land at all; nothing for fishermen, who are,
if possible, worse off at the end of the fishing season than they
were at the beginning. The money appropriated for the
building of piers and harbors and the purchase of boats has
not as yet been put to its proper use.</p></blockquote>

<h2><a name="TO_THE_EAST_COAST_AND_BACK" id="TO_THE_EAST_COAST_AND_BACK"></a>
TO THE EAST COAST, AND BACK
AGAIN.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">One</span> always hears of Highland scenery at its
best; one usually sees it at its worst. We found
the trip from Oban to Inverness up the Caledonian
Canal as tedious as it is said to be charming. The
day was gray and misty and rainy. In the first
boat we sat in the cabin, in the second under an
awning. Occasionally we went on deck to look
for the sights of the journey.</p>

<p>As we steamed up Loch Linne a Scotchman
pointed out Ben-Nevis.</p>

<p>"Well," said J&mdash;&mdash;, critically, "if you were to
put a top on it, it might make a fairly decent
mountain."</p>

<p>After that we were left to find the sights for
ourselves.</p>

<p>The day would have been unbearably dull but
for the exertions of a Mr. Macdonell. He was, I
am as ashamed to say as he seemed to be, our fellow-countryman.
He did not look in the least
like an American, nor like an Englishman, though
his ulster, coat, trousers, collar, necktie, gloves, and
hat were all so English. He was a middle-aged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
man, handsome, and gentlemanly enough until he
began to talk. At the very start he told everybody
on board in general and each individual in
particular that he was a Macdonell. As all the
people about here are Macdonells, no one was
startled. The name in these parts is rather more
common than, and about as distinguished as, Smith
in the Directory.</p>

<p>"I'm a Macdonell," he said, "and I'm proud of
it. It's a great clan. No matter what our nationality
may be now, sir, we're all Macdonells still.
I'll tell you the way we do in our clan. Not long
ago one of the Macdonells of Lochaber was married.
He was not very rich&mdash;he had about £12,000 a year
perhaps&mdash;and the Macdonells thought it would be
a nice thing to give him a present of money from
Macdonells all over the world. There was not a
Macdonell who did not respond. I was in Melbourne
at the time, and I was proud to give my
guinea. Now, how different it was with Grant,
that man who was President of the United States.
The clan Grant tried to do the same thing when
one of their chief's family was married, and the
factor sent to this Grant, and said they would be
very proud and had no doubt he would be very
glad to contribute to this happy occasion in the
old clan. And what do you think he answered?
He indorsed on the letter sent him&mdash;I saw it myself&mdash;that
he was not one of the tenantry, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
therefore would not contribute. That shows what
a snob he was. But it's very different with the
Macdonells. I'll tell you what happened to me the
other day near Banavie. I lost one of my gloves;
they were driving gloves&mdash;expensive gloves, you
know. I gave the odd one to the driver, and said
if he could find the other he would have a pair.
The next day he came to me with both gloves.
'Sir,' he said, 'I cannot keep them; I too am a
Macdonell!' I gave him the other glove and a
guinea. That shows the fine clannish feeling."</p>

<p>We have heard that there is a proverb about
fools and Americans.</p>

<p>Mr. Macdonell stood on the upper deck to look
towards the country of the Macdonells, which he
could not see through the mist. He took out
his guide-book and read poetry and facts about his
clan, to two American girls, until, quite audibly,
they pronounced it all stuff and him a bore. He
praised the Macdonell chiefs to Englishmen until
they laughed almost in his face. "The Duke of
New York," they called him before evening. He
sang the praises of his Macdonell land to any one
who would listen. "I like it better than Switzerland
or our own country," he said; "I'm coming
back next year to rent a shooting-place. But the
trouble is the people here don't like us. It's the
fault of men like Carnegie. He comes and gives
them £20,000 for a library. And then what does<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
he do? He makes a speech against their queen.
It's shocking. It's atrocious."</p>

<p>I wonder why Americans, as soon as they borrow
the Englishman's clothes, must add his worst traits
to their own faults. "That kind of American,"
a Londoner on board said to us, "has all the arrogance
and insolence of a lord combined with the
ignorance and snobbishness of a cad." He was
right. Of all the men who rent the great deer
forests of Scotland, none are such tyrants as the
American millionaires who come over, as Mr.
Macdonell probably will next summer, for the shooting.
More than one Scotchman we met told us
so plainly. There is a famous case where the
cruelty of an American sportsman, who plays the
laird in the Highlands, so far outdid that of the
real laird that the latter came forward to defend
his people against it! Now that the war of emancipation
is being fought from one end of Great
Britain to the other, it is to our shame that there
are Americans who uphold the oppressors. One
might think we struggled for freedom at home
only to strive against it abroad. Mrs. Stowe could
write "Uncle Tom's Cabin" on behalf of slaves in
the United States; in Great Britain she saw only
the nobility and benevolence of the slave-driver.
From the plantations of the South there never
rose such a cry of sorrow and despair as that which
rang through the glens and straths of Sutherland<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
when men were driven to the sea to make room
for sheep. And yet to Mrs. Stowe this inhuman
chase was but a sublime instance of the benevolent
employment of superior wealth and power in shortening
the struggle of advancing civilization, and
elevating in a few years a whole community to a
point of education and material prosperity which,
unassisted, they might never have attained. You
might as well call the slavery of negroes a sublime
instance of the power of traders to shorten
the natural course of human development, since if
left to themselves the blacks could not have advanced
beyond the savage state in which they
were found. I fear the American love for a lord
is not exaggerated, if even Mrs. Stowe could be
blinded by it.</p>

<p>There was little to break the monotony of the
journey except the Macdonells. "If the sun only
shone," Mrs. Macdonell explained, "there would be
the lights and shadows." As it was, however, water
and sky and shores were of uniform grayness.
Now and then we passed the ruins of an old castle.
At a place whose name I have forgotten the boat
stopped that everybody might walk a mile or more
to see a water-fall. It may have been our loss that
we did not go with the rest; certainly a party of
Frenchmen on their return declared it <i>une cascade
vraiment charmante</i>. At Fort Augustus
the boat was three-quarters of an hour getting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
through the locks, and in the mean time enterprising
tourists climbed the tower of the new Benedictine
monastery, which stands where was once
the old fort. We went instead to the telegraph
office, and secured a room in Inverness, and gave
the landlord an order for the letters we hoped
were waiting for us at the bank. Young Benedictines
in black gowns, like students of the Propaganda
on the Pincian, were walking out two by
two.</p>

<p>These were the day's excitements.</p>

<p>As we neared Inverness, Mr. Macdonell was again
on deck. "I always go to the Caledonian Hotel
in Inverness," he told us. "What I like is to
stay at the best hotels, where I meet the society
of England and Scotland&mdash;the real society. There's
the Royal Hotel in Edinburgh; it suits me because
you are sure to find it full of good English
and Scotch society. I must always have the best
society. Besides, they're very good hotels, both
of them. In our country we boast of the products
of the Chesapeake; but we have nothing so delicious,
nothing so delicate, as the fresh herring
they will serve you for breakfast at the Caledonian."</p>

<p>As we drove from the boat to</p>


<h3>INVERNESS,</h3>

<p>we passed the stage of the Caledonian Hotel. In it
sat the Macdonell with a family of Jews, and an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
Englishman and his daughter who, throughout the
journey, had shown themselves so superior, we
should not wonder some day to find them behind
the counter of an Oxford Street store. They were
all on their way to mingle with the real society of
England and Scotland.</p>

<p>It probably was a pleasure to Mr. Macdonell to
find that the tobacconist next to the hotel, and the
dry goods merchant but a few doors off, were his
fellow-clansmen. In fact, every other banner&mdash;I
mean sign&mdash;flung out on the outward walls of Inverness
bore his name.</p>

<p>Our social pretensions were more modest. We
went to the Station Hotel for comfort, and trusted
to luck for society. In the great hall of the hotel
we first realized the full extent of our shabbiness.
Our knapsacks shrank out of sight of porters and
maids. The proprietor was too busy distributing
rooms to decently dressed travellers&mdash;the most gorgeous
of whom gloried in his allegiance to the
<i>Police Gazette</i> of New York&mdash;to notice us. But
as he paused for a moment, J&mdash;&mdash; asked if there
were any letters for Mr. Pennell. "Where is
Mr. Pennell?" asked the proprietor, with interest.
When he heard where he was, then came the
transformation scene. Two gentlemen in dress-coats,
each carrying a diminutive knapsack preceded
us up the stairs; two gentlemen in dress-coats,
each carrying a huge bundle of letters, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
accumulation of weeks, followed us. We felt like
a lord mayor's procession, but we did not look it.
We were led into the best bedroom, but before
the door was closed we thought we saw disappointment
in the eyes of the proprietor. We at once
consulted the tariff on the wall to learn what it
cost to send a telegram in Scotland. We can only
say that it did not prove very expensive, that the
hotel was very good, that everybody was very attentive,
and that the society may have been the
best for all we knew.</p>

<p>The next morning we started on foot, all our
baggage on our backs, to the disgust of the gentlemen
in dress-coats. We walked at a good pace out
of the town, and on the broad, smooth road that
leads to Culloden. The country was quiet and pastoral,
and the way, in places, pleasant and shady.
It was a striking contrast to the western wilderness
from which we had just come.</p>

<p>But twenty miles lay between us and Nairn;
like Dr. Johnson, we were going out of our way
to see Culloden Moor and Cawdor Castle. The
road was too good. It set us thinking again of a
tricycle on which we could travel at stimulating
speed over country monotonous in its prosperous
prettiness. Walking meant steady trudging all
day, and a hasty glance at castle and moor when
we came to them.</p>

<p>It was unbearable. Weeks of experience had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
taught us all the drudgery of tramping, none of
its supposed delights. We asked people we met
if there was a cycle agent in Inverness. No one
knew. Then the trees by the road-side gave place
to open country with waving wheat-fields; and oh,
how hot it grew! Peddlers whom we had passed&mdash;the
only people, besides ourselves, we saw tramping
in Scotland&mdash;overtook and passed us. Two men
went by on bicycles. How cool and comfortable
they looked! How hot and dirty and dusty and
miserable we felt! This was too much.</p>

<p>"Confound this walking! If ever I walk again!"
said J&mdash;&mdash;; and, almost within sight of Culloden,
he turned. After looking over to where I knew
the moor must be, I meekly followed him, and in
silence we went back to Inverness.</p>

<p>The roads about here being particularly good,
there was not a cycle agent in the town. There
was no getting a machine for love or money. It
was now too late to attempt to walk to Nairn.
There was nothing to do but to train it. In the
interval of waiting we saw Inverness. It is a
pretty city, with a wide river flowing through it,
many bridges&mdash;one with a great stone archway&mdash;a
new cathedral, and a battlemented, turreted castle
high above the river. Clothes dry on the green
bank that slopes down to the water's edge, women
in white caps go and come through the streets,
which, with their gabled houses, show that curious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
French feeling found all over the East of Scotland,
and even the costumes of the women help
to carry it out.</p>

<p>In Inverness, and in fact all the way to Fraserburgh,
J&mdash;&mdash; made many notes and sketches, the
best, he says, of our journey. All but a few have
been lost, and so the world will never enjoy them.
This is sad, but true. If any one should happen
to find the sketch-book he need not return it in
hopes of a reward. J&mdash;&mdash; has no use for it at this
moment. In fact, the finder had better keep it;
it may be valuable some day.</p>

<p>When the train reached</p>


<h3>NAIRN,</h3>

<p>"Well," said J&mdash;&mdash;, in triumph, "we've got
through a day's work in half an hour;" and we
dropped our knapsacks at the hotel and set out
for Cawdor, which is five miles from the town.</p>

<p>The day so far had been fine. Once we were
on the road again the sun went behind the clouds,
mist fell over the country before us. A lady in a
dog-cart warned us of rain, and offered us a lift. To
make up for the morning's weakness, we refused
heroically. There was nothing by the way but
broad fields of grain, which seemed broader after
the wretched little patches of Skye and Harris,
and large farm-houses, larger by comparison with
Hebridean hovels. When the roofs and gables of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
the castle came in sight, had we had our Macbeth
at our fingers' ends, I have no doubt we might
have made an appropriate quotation. A long
fence separated two fields; on each post sat a solemn
rook, and hundreds more made black the near
grass. But we did not call them birds of ill-omen
and speak of the past as we should have done;
J&mdash;&mdash; only said it was right to find so many cawing
things at the gate of Cawdor Castle.</p>

<p>I wish that we had found nothing worse. Just
as we reached it the mist turned to heavy rain.
This is the depressing side of sight-seeing in Scotland;
you must take your holidays in water-proofs.
J&mdash;&mdash; made several sketches, for the rain poured
in such torrents our stay was long. We stood
under the old gate-way and at the window of the
porter's lodge. The sketches were very charming,
very beautiful, but they are lost! We walked
about in the rain and looked at the castle from
every side. But as everybody who has travelled in
Scotland has described Cawdor, there is no special
reason why I should do it again. The sketches
would have been original.</p>

<p>The most provoking part of it was that we had
scarce left the castle a mile behind when the rain
became mist again; at the third mile-stone we
were once more in a dry world.</p>

<p>Boswell called Nairn "a miserable place." Dr.
Johnson said next to nothing about it. Perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
the people laughed at them as they did at us.
We thought their manners miserable, though their
town now is decent enough. It is long and narrow,
stretching from the railway-station to the
sea. After the hotels and shops, we came to the
fishermen's quarter. The houses were mostly
new; a few turned old gables and chimneys to
the street. Women in white caps, with great baskets
on their backs, strode homeward in the twilight.
Everywhere brown nets were spread out
to dry, boats lay along the sands, beyond was the
sea, and the smell of the fish was over it all.</p>

<p>The next morning we learned from the maid
that Macbeth's blasted heath was but a few miles
from Nairn; all the theatricals went there, she
said. We made a brave start; but bravery gave
out with the first mile. Walking was even more
unbearable than it had been the day before. There
could be nothing more depressing than to walk on
a public highway through a well-cultivated country
under a hot sun. Already, when we came to
the near village of Auldearn, we had outwalked
interest in everything but our journey's end. We
would not go an extra step for the monuments the
guide-book directs the tourist to see, though the
graveyard was within sight of the road.</p>

<p>Macbeth seems to have shared the fate of prophets
in their own country. We asked a man passing
with a goat the distance to Macbeth's Hill, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
it is called on the map. He didna know, he answered.
But presently he ran after us. Was the
gentleman we spoke of a farmer? Another man,
however, knew all about it. He had never been
to the top of the hill; he had been told there were
trees up there, and that it wasn't different from
the other hills around. And yet he had heard people
came great distances to see it. He supposed
we had travelled far just to go up the hill. He
knew from our talk, many words of which he
couldna understand, that we were no from this
part of the country. But then sometimes he
couldna understand the broad Scotch of the people
in Aberdeenshire. There were some people
hereabouts who could talk only Gaelic. They had
been turned off the Western Islands, and had settled
here years ago, but they still talked only the
Gaelic.</p>

<p>He went our way for half a mile or less, and he
walked with us. His clothes were ragged, his
feet bare, and over his shoulders was slung a small
bundle done up in a red handkerchief. In the last
three years, he said, he had had but two or three
days' work. Work was hard to get. Here rents
were high, farmers complained, and this year the
crops were ruined because of the long drought.
He did think at times of going to America. He
had a sister who had gone to live in Pittsburg.
It might be a good thing. There are Scotchmen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
who have done well in Pittsburg. He left us with
minute directions. The hill, though not far from
the road, which now went between pine woods
and heather, could not be seen from it. We came
to the point at which we should have turned to
the blasted heath.</p>

<p>"It's a blasted nuisance," J&mdash;&mdash; said, and we
kept straight on to the nearest railway-station.</p>

<p>This was Brodie. The porters told us there was
a fine castle within a ten minutes' walk, and a train
for Elgin in fifteen minutes. We waited for the
train.</p>

<p>We were so tired, so disgusted, that everything
put us out of patience. Even a small boy who had
walked with us earlier in the morning to show us
the way, simply by stopping when we stopped and
starting when we started, had driven us almost frantic.
I mention this to show how utterly wearisome
a walking tour through beautiful country can be.</p>

<p>At the town of</p>


<h3>ELGIN</h3>

<p>we were in the humor to moralize on modern
degeneracy among the ruins. A distillery is now
the near neighbor of the cathedral. Below the
broken walls, still rich with beautiful carving,
new and old gravestones, as at Iona, stand side by
side. In nave and transepts knights lie on old
tombstones, under canopies carved with leaves and
flowers; here and there in the graveyard without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
are moss-grown slabs with the death's-head and
graceful lettering of the seventeenth century; near
by are ugly blocks from the modern stone-mason.
The guide-book quotes some of the old inscriptions;
but it omits one of late date, which should,
however, receive the greatest honor&mdash;that of the
man who cared for the ruins with reverence and
love until the Government took them in charge.
These ruins are very beautiful. Indeed, nowhere
does the religious vandalism of the past seem more
monstrous than in Scotland. The Government
official asked us to write our names in the Visitors'
Book; he made it seem a compliment by saying
that it was not everybody's name he wanted. We
thought him a man of much greater intelligence
than the Glasgow verger. He could see, he said,
that J&mdash;&mdash; knew something about cathedrals and
architecture.</p>

<p>We found nothing else of interest in Elgin. It
had a prosperous look, and we saw not a trace of
the old timbered houses with projecting upper
stories of which Dr. Johnson writes. The remainder
of our stay we spent in a restaurant near
the station, where we talked politics with a farmer.
He lectured us on free-trade. Scotch farmers cry
for protection, he said, but they don't know what
it means. Free-trade is good for the bulk of the
people, and what would protection do for the
farmer? Nothing! If he got higher prices, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
landlord would say, Now you can afford to pay me
higher rent, and he would pocket the few shillings'
difference.</p>

<p>We talked with many other farmers in the east
of Scotland. Sometimes we journeyed with them
in railway-carriages; sometimes we breakfasted
and dined with them in hotels. They all had
much to say about protection and free-trade, and
we found that Henry George had been among
them. Their ideas of his doctrine of the nationalization
of the land were at times curious and original.
I remember a farmer from Aberdeenshire
who told us that he believed in it thoroughly, and
then explained that it would give each man permission,
if he had money enough, to buy out his
landlord.</p>

<p>After our lunch at Elgin we again got through
a day's work in less than an hour. We went by
train to</p>


<h3>BUCKIE,</h3>

<p>a place of which we had never heard before that
afternoon. How J&mdash;&mdash; happened to buy tickets
for it I cannot explain, since he never made it
quite clear to me. We found it a large and apparently
thriving fishing town, with one long line
of houses low on the shore, another above on the
hill, and a very good hotel, the name of which I
am not sure we knew at the time; certainly we
do not remember it now.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"> <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>

</div>
<p class="caption">FISHER-BOATS HAULED UP NEAR BUCKIE.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>It was at Buckie that J&mdash;&mdash; made several of the
best sketches in the lost sketch-book in the evening
as we watched the boats sail silently out from the
harbor. The sun had just set. The red light of
the after-glow shone upon the water. Against it,
here and there, the brown sails stood out in strong
relief. Other boats lay at anchor in the cool gray
of the harbor.</p>

<p>In the morning we made a new start on foot.
Now and then, for a short distance, the road went
inland across treeless, cultivated country; but the
greater part of the time it lay near the sea, and
kept wandering in and out of little fishing villages,
in each of which the lost sketch-book came into
play. They were all much alike; there was usually
the harbor, where the fishing-boats were moored,
some with brown sails hung out to dry and flapping
slowly in the breeze; others with long lines of
floats stretched from mast to mast; and as it was
not only low tide but near the end of the fishing
season, all were drawn up in picturesque masses in
the foreground, the light of sea and sky bright and
glittering behind them. Carts full of nets, men
and women with huge bundles of them on their
backs, were always on their way either up or down
the hill at whose foot the village nestled; or on
the level at its top the nets were spread like great
snares, not for birds, but for any one who tried to
walk across them. Boxes and barrels of salted fish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
were piled along the street. In the air was the
strong smell of herrings. In every village new
houses were being or had just been built, but the
soft gray smoke hovering above the roofs toned
down their aggressive newness. In their midst
was the plain white kirk.</p>

</div>

<p>There were so many villages that
we could not complain of monotony;
and then sometimes, on the stretch of beach beyond,
dismantled boats in various stages of decline
were pulled up out of reach of the tide. Sometimes
on the near links men were playing golf.
Once we passed three, each putting his little white
ball on a bit of turf. They were very serious about
it. "Now to business," we heard one say as we
went by. But it grew very hot towards noon, and
in the heat our first enthusiasm melted. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
Cullen came in sight we were again declaring that
nothing would induce us to walk another step.</p>

<p class="caption">NEAR CULLEN.</p>

<p>However, a hearty lunch changed our minds.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
The truth is, we hated to give in. Though we
were quite certain we would never tramp again,
we were unwilling to confess our one walk a failure.
At the hotel we were told that the road to
Banff, our next stopping-place, kept inland, but the
landlady thought that to the nearest village at least
there was a path by the shore. A man on the outskirts
of the town tried to dissuade us from going
that way; there was such a brae to be climbed, he
said. But there seemed no doubt about the path.
When we persisted, he walked back with us to direct
us the better, J&mdash;&mdash; talking to him about the
brae as if he had never heard of a hill in his life,
the man describing the difficulties before us as if
ours was an Alpine expedition. The hill was steep
enough. At the top there was no path, but instead
a field of tall prickly furze, through which we
waded. Oh, the misery of that five minutes' walk!
At every step we were stung and pricked by hundreds
of points sharper than needles. And after
that we skirted wheat and turnip fields, because
when we tried to cross them, as we were not sportsmen,
there was some one near at hand to stop us.
We went up and down ravines, and picked our way
through tall grass at the very edge of sheer cliffs.
The afternoon was hotter than the morning had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
been. A warm haze hung over the level stretch
of country and the distant hills. The sky seemed
to have fallen down upon the sea; there was not a
line to mark where it met the water. The few
brown-sailed boats looked as if they were forcing
their way between, holding up the heavens on
their masts.</p>

</div>
<p class="caption">BIT OF MACDUFF.</p>

<p>In one place, on a high rock jutting out into the
sea, was a low broken wall of rough masonry, all
that is left of Findlater Castle.</p>

<p>There was no use in trying to keep up any longer.
Our backs ached, our shoulders were cut;
we were hot, dusty, exhausted, and, in a word, at
the end of our physical and moral forces. This
scramble on the cliffs ended our walking tour.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>At Sandend we took the train for Banff; but
first we went down to the shore; for Sandend was
a picturesque little village, with all its gables turned
towards the sea, big black boats on the beach,
rocks beyond, and a pretty blue bay of its own.
Three artists had left their easels to eat buns out
of a brown-paper bag and drink beer out of bottles,
under the shade of one of the boats. J&mdash;&mdash;,
having already learned the exclusiveness of British
artists, took out his sketch-book at a safe distance.
He only spoke to them to ask the way to the station.
He did not dare to talk about work.</p>

<p>A little farther on we again asked the way, this
time of a girl hanging up clothes. J&mdash;&mdash;'s questions
and her answers were typical of many conversations,
bad for one's temper, that we held on
the east coast.</p>

<p>"Where is the railway-station?"</p>

<p>"What station?"</p>

<p>"Where the train comes in."</p>

<p>"There;" and she pointed to a house beyond
the village.</p>

<p>"How do you get there?"</p>

<p>"By the road."</p>

<p>"Can you go up by the hill?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Which is better?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"Which is shorter?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>"Up the hill."</p>

<p>We started up the hill, but there was no path.
"There is no path," we said to her.</p>

<p>"No, there's no path."</p>

<p>We came to</p>


<h3>BANFF</h3>

<p>late in the afternoon, just as the fishing-boats
were putting out to sea, one beyond another on
the gray water, the farthest but faint specks on
the horizon. The best thing about Banff is that
in fifteen or twenty minutes you can be out of it
and in Macduff. The shore here makes a great
curve. On one point is Banff, on the other Macduff;
half-way between, a many-arched bridge
spans the river Deveron, and close by the big
house of the Earl of Fife shows through the trees
of his park. High on the hill of Macduff stands
the white kirk; it overlooks the town, with its
many rows of fishermen's houses, and the harbor,
where the black masts rise far above the gray
walls, and the fishermen spread out their nets to
dry, and the dark-sailed boats are always coming
and going, and boys paddle in the twilight. And
if you go to the far end of the harbor, where the
light-house is, you look to the spires and chimneys
and roofs of Banff climbing up their hill-side, and
beyond to a shadowy point of land like a pale
gray cloud-bank on the water.</p>

<p>It was easy to see what they thought of us at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
the Fife Arms, where we stayed in Banff. We
were given our breakfast with the nurse and children
of an A. R. A., while the great man breakfasted
in state in a near dining-room. They ate
very like ordinary children, but their clothes
showed them to be little boys and girls of æsthetic
distinction. I fear, however, we were not
properly impressed.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a name="NEAR_BANFF" id="NEAR_BANFF"></a><a href="images/illus213a.jpg"><img src="images/illus213.jpg" width="528" height="477" alt="NEAR BANFF." title="" /></a>
</div>
<p class="caption">NEAR BANFF.</p>

<p>There was no doubt that now our walking was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
all done. We asked about the stage for Fraserburgh,
as if staging with us was a matter of course.
It was a relief not to begin the day by strapping
heavy knapsacks to our backs. The hours of waiting
were spent partly in strolling through the
streets of Banff, where here and there is an old
gray house with pretty turret at its corner, or
quaint old inscription with coat of arms or figures
let into its walls; partly in sitting on the beach
looking out on a hot blue sea.</p>

<p>But hot as it was in the morning, a sharp, cold
wind was blowing when, at three o'clock, we took
our seats in the little old-fashioned stage that runs
between Banff and Fraserburgh. Stage and coachman
and passengers seemed like a page out of
Dickens transposed to Scotland. Inside was a
very small boy, put there by a fat woman in black,
and left, with many exhortations and a couple of
buns, to make the journey alone; opposite to him
sat a melancholy man who saw but ruin staring
in the face of farmers and fishermen alike. At
every corner in Banff and Macduff we stopped
for more passengers, until the stage, elastic as it
seemed, was full to overflowing, and we took refuge
on the top. Here the seats were crowded with
men, their heads tied up in scarfs. The coachman
was carrier as well, and at different points in
the open country women and children waited by
the road to give him, or to take from him, bundles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
>and boxes and letters. He was the typical cheery
carrier. He had a word for everybody, even for
a young man who dropped his wheelbarrow to flap
his arms and greet us with a vacant smile. He
was a puir thing, the driver explained, who went
wrong only four years ago. He was the third we
had seen in two days.</p>

</div>
<p class="caption">BANFF, FROM MACDUFF.</p>

<p>Many of the carrier's jokes we lost. A commercial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
traveller, who sat next to us, supposed we could
not understand some of the expressions hereabouts.
He might better have said we could not understand
the language. We could make out enough, however,
to find that one joke went a long way. A
man in the front seat, trying to light his pipe in
the wind, set off the whole box of matches. "That's
extravagance," said the carrier; and when another
box was handed to the man, he told him that these
were safety matches&mdash;it took only one to light a
pipe; and this he kept saying over and over again,
with many chuckles, for the next half-hour. We
had a specimen, too, of Scotch humor. At one
stopping-place the commercial traveller got down
and went into the public-house. A family party
scrambled up and filled every seat, his with the
rest. J&mdash;&mdash; remonstrated; but the man of the
party answered that he paid his money for a seat
as well as anybody else. "An empty seat's naebody's
seat," he argued, and carrier and passengers
roared at his fun.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>The country was dreary, for all its cultivation.
The fields were without tree or hedge to break
their monotony. The villages were full of new
houses. There was nothing striking or picturesque
until we came within sight of Fraserburgh. Far
across a level stretch we first saw it, its spires rising
high above gray and red roofs. The near meadows
were dark with fishing-nets; in places fishermen
were at work spreading them over the grass; and
we began to pass carts heavily laden with their
brown masses, and men and women bent under the
same burdens.</p>


<h3>FRASERBURGH.</h3>

<p>We walked out after supper. Rain was falling,
and the evening was growing dark. Down by the
harbor carts were still going and coming; men
were still busy with their nets. Along the quay
was a succession of basins, and these opened into
others beyond. All were crowded with boats, and
their thickly clustered masts seemed, in the gathering
shadows, like a forest of branchless, leafless
trees. One by one lights were hung out. On the
town side of the quay, in crypt-like rooms and under
low sheds, torches flamed and flared against a
background of darkness. Their strong light fell
upon women clothed in strange stuffs that glistened
and glittered, their heads bound with white
cloths. They were bending over shiny, ever-shifting
masses piled at their feet, and chanting a wild<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
Gaelic song that rose and fell with the wailing of
all savage music. As we first saw them, from a
distance, they might have been so many sorceresses
at their magic rites. When we drew near we
found that they were but the fish-curers' gutters
and packers at work. Thanks to Cable and Lafcadio
Hearn, we know something of the songs of
work at home; but who in England cares about
the singing in these fishing towns&mdash;singing which
is only wilder and weirder than that of the cotton
pressers of Louisiana? To the English literary
man, however&mdash;the Charles Reades are the exceptions&mdash;I
fear the gutters would be but nasty, dirty
fisher persons. Now and then groups of these
women passed us, walking with long strides, their
arms swinging, and their short skirts and white-bound
heads shining through the sombre streets.
Over the town was the glow of the many fires.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>
<p class="caption">FRASERBURGH.</p>

<p>In the morning there was less mystery, but not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
less picturesqueness. We were up in time to go
to the harbor with the fishermen's wives, and watch
the boats come in. Everything was fresh after a
night of rain. It was still early, and the sun sent
a path of gold across the sea just where the boats
turned on their last tack homeward. Each brown
sail was set in bold relief against the shining east,
and then slowly lowered, as the fishermen with
their long poles pushed the boats into the already
crowded harbor. At once nets were emptied of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
the fish, which lay gleaming like silver through
the brown meshes. Women and boys came to fill
baskets with the fresh herrings; carts were loaded
with them. In other boats men were hanging up
their floats and shaking out their nets. The water
was rich with the many black and brown reflections,
only brightened here and there by lines of
blue or purple or white from the distinguishing
rings of color on each mast. There was a never-ending
stream of men and carts passing along the
quay. Many fishermen with their bags were on
their way to the station, for the fishing season was
almost over. So they said. But when one thousand
boats came in, and twenty thousand fisher-folk
were that day in Fraserburgh, to us it looked little
like the end. In all this busy place we heard no
English. Only Gaelic was spoken, as if we were
once more in the Western Islands.</p>

<p>It was the same in the streets. The day's work
in the curing-houses was just about to begin. Girls
and women in groups of threes and fours were
walking towards them. In the morning light we
could see that the greater number were young.
All were neat and clean, with hair carefully parted
and well brushed, little shawls over their shoulders,
but nothing on their heads. They carried
their working clothes under their arms, and kept
knitting as they walked. Like the men, they all
talked Gaelic.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a name="IN_THE_HARBOR_FRASERBURGH" id="IN_THE_HARBOR_FRASERBURGH"></a><a href="images/illus223a.jpg"><img src="images/illus223.jpg" width="700" height="380" alt="IN THE HARBOR, FRASERBURGH." title="" /></a>
</div>
<p class="caption">IN THE HARBOR, FRASERBURGH.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>When they got to work, we found that those
strange stuffs which had glistened in the torch-light
were aprons and bibs smeared with scales and
slime, that the white head-dresses were worn only
for cleanliness, that the shining masses at their
feet were but piles of herring. I have never seen
women work so hard or so fast. Their arms, as
they seized the fish, gutted them, and threw them
in the buckets, moved with the regularity and the
speed of machines. Indeed, there could not be a
busier place than Fraserburgh. All day long the
boats kept coming in, nets were emptied, fish
carted away. The harbor, the streets, the fields
beyond where nets were taken to dry, the curing-houses,
were alike scenes of industry. If the women
put down their knives, it was only to take up
their knitting. And yet these men and women,
working incessantly by day and by night, were
almost all Western Islanders&mdash;the people who, we
are told, are so slovenly and so lazy! No one who
comes with them to the east coast for the fishing
season will ever again believe in the oft-repeated
lies about their idleness.</p>

<p>There were no signs of rest until Saturday evening.
Then no boats went out, and the harbor and
curing-houses were deserted. The streets were full
of men and women walking about for pleasure.
The greatest crowd was in the market-place, where
a few "cheap Jacks" drove their trade. Two,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
who dealt in china, as if to make up for their poor
patter, threw cups and saucers recklessly into the
air, breaking them with great clatter, while the
women and girls they had attracted stood by and
bought nothing.</p>

<p>The fishermen had gathered about a third, who
sold cheap and tawdry ornaments, but who could
patter. When we first came near he was holding
up six imitation gold watch-chains, and offering
the buyers prizes into the bargain. "O ye men
of little faith!"&mdash;shaking his fist at them&mdash;"can't
any of you favor me with a shillin'? You don't
want 'em, gen'lemen? Then there'll be smashin'
of teeth and tearin' of hair. Glory! glory hallylujah!"
All this, I regret to say, was interspersed
with stories that do not bear repetition. But he
sold his watch-chains without trouble. "And now,
gen'lemen, for any of you that wants to take home
a present to your wife and chil'ren, here's an
album. It'd adorn a nobleman's mansion, and
wouldn't disgrace a fisherman's cottage. It's
bound in moroccer and stamped with gold, and'll
hold many pictures. I'll only sell half a dozen,
and it's the very thing you wants. You'll have
one? Well, sir, I can't reach you, but these gen'lemen'll
pass it along."</p>

<p>And then he began again with the stories and
the Scripture until he had sold out all his stock
of albums and note-books and cheap jewellery.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a name="GUTTERS_AT_WORK_FRASERBURGH" id="GUTTERS_AT_WORK_FRASERBURGH"></a><a href="images/illus227a.jpg"><img src="images/illus227.jpg" width="602" height="404" alt="GUTTERS AT WORK, FRASERBURGH." title="" /></a>
</div>
<p class="caption">GUTTERS AT WORK, FRASERBURGH.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>It was the hint about presents to those left behind
which bore greatest weight with the fishermen.
It never failed. But we remembered their
cottages and the sadness of their homes, and it angered
us that they should be duped into wasting
their hard-won earnings on tawdry ornaments. It
seems to be their fate to be cheated by every one.
Even the peddler, like the parson and the landlord,
can pervert Scripture to their discomfort.</p>

<p>Still, there was a pleasant suggestion of holiday-making
in the square. It was the first time we
had seen the Western Islanders amusing themselves.
True, they did it very solemnly. There
was little laughter and much silence; but at least
a touch of brightness was given to the gloom of
their long life of work and want.</p>

<p>Even on Sunday we thought the people more
cheerful. In the morning the women, the little
shawls over their shoulders, their heads still bare,
the men in blue cloth, many without coats, again
filled the streets on their way to church. In the
afternoon we walked to two near fishing villages.
In one an old fisherman was talking about Christ
to a few villagers. We sat a while close to the sea,
looking out to the next village, gray against gray
gold-lined clouds, to the water with the light falling
softly across it, to the little quiet pools in
among the low rocks of the shore, to the big black
boats drawn up on the beach. And then, as we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
walked back to Fraserburgh, the mist fell suddenly.
But the road near the town was crowded with
the men in blue cloth and the women in short
skirts. Some were singing hymns as they walked.
To us they looked strong and healthy, and even
happy. It seemed as if this life on the east coast
must make up for many of the hardships they
endure in the deserts of their western home.</p>

<p>That same evening in the hotel we heard about
life in Fraserburgh, which looks so prosperous to
the stranger. A Catholic priest came into the dining-room
after supper. He seemed very tired.
He had been visiting the sick all day, he told us.
Measles had broken out among the women and
girls from the Hebrides. Many had already died;
more had been carried to the hospital. The rooms
provided for them by the curers were small and
overcrowded. So long as they were kept in their
present quarters, so long would disease and death
be their portion. Their condition was dreadful;
but they worked hard, and never complained. He
came from the west coast of Ireland, he said, where
Irish poverty is at its worst, but not even there had
he seen misery as great as that of the Western Islanders.
He knew it well. He had lived with
them in the Long Island, where many are Catholics.
If the Highlands were represented by eighty-five
members, all wanting Home Rule, more would
have been heard about destitution in the Hebrides.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
In the prosperous days of the east coast fisheries
the people's burden had been less heavy; but now
they came to the fishing towns of the east, the
women to sicken and to die, the men to beg their
way back as best they could. There were too many
fishermen here, just as at home landlords thought
there were too many crofters.</p>

</div>
<p class="caption">COMING HOME FROM THE FISHERIES, FRASERBURGH.</p>

<p>The fishers also shall mourn, and all they that
cast angle shall lament, and they that spread nets
upon the waters shall languish.</p>

<p>The epidemic and its causes became the town
talk. The Gaelic Free Kirk minister, differ as he
might from the Catholic priest on every other
point, on this could but agree with him. He told
us the same story in words as strong. It was
shameful, he said, the way these poor girls were
being killed. He had not known it before; but
now that he did, he could not and would not let the
matter rest. An indignation meeting of the people
of Fraserburgh was called for the day we left. The
town was placarded with the notices. Since then
the report must have gone abroad. Now that
agitation in Lewis is forcing attention to the islands
and their people, in London there has been
formed a committee of <i>ladies</i> to look into the condition
of the girls and women who work on the
east coast.</p>

<p>That last morning, as we stood by the hotel door,
the funeral of one of the dead women passed up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
the street towards the station. Fifty or sixty fishermen
followed the coffin. When we took our
seats in a third-class carriage we found the Free
Kirk minister there before us. The coffin had just
been put on the train. Two girls came up to
speak to him. He stretched out his hand; one
took and held it as she struggled to answer his
questions; the other turned away with the tears
streaming down her face. As the train started
they stood apart, their heads bent low, their faces
buried in their shawls, both crying as if their
hearts would break. And so, at the last, we saw
only the sadness of Fraserburgh.</p>

<p>We had intended going to Peterhead and the
smaller fishing towns by the way; but our energy
was less inexhaustible than the picturesqueness
of the east coast. Our journey had been
over-long. We were beginning to be anxious to
bring it to an end. Now we went straight to</p>


<h3>ABERDEEN,</h3>

<p>where we at once fell back into ordinary city life.
We even did a little shopping in its fine new
streets. Its large harbor seemed empty after that
of Fraserburgh. Many fishing-boats were at sea;
many had gone altogether. The fishing season
here was really well over. We walked to the old
town after dinner. In it there is not much to be
seen but the university tower with the famous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
crown atop, and the cathedral, which looked massive
and impressive in the twilight. We saw
much more of Aberdeen; but we are quite of
the same mind as Dr. Johnson, that to write of
such well-known cities "with the solemnity of
geographical description, as if we had been cast
upon a newly discovered coast, has the appearance
of a very frivolous ostentation."</p>

</div>
<p class="caption">ENTRANCE TO THE HARBOR AT MONTROSE.</p>

<p>From Aberdeen to Edinburgh we trained it by
easy stages. We stopped often; once at</p>


<h3>MONTROSE,</h3>

<p>where, like Dr. Johnson, and for that matter, every
one else who comes here, we looked to the Grampian
Hills in the distance. The town itself was
not picturesque. The guide-book calls it neat and
Flemish, probably because it has fewer houses with
high gables turned towards the street than can be
seen, as a rule, in any Scotch town. But the harbor,
of which the guide-book says less, was fine. We
spent hours near the mouth of the river, looking
over to the fishermen's houses on the opposite
shore. There were constant showers as we sat
there; every few minutes the sun came out from
the clouds, and the wet roofs glistened and glittered
through the smoke hanging above them. In
the morning, women, packed like herrings in the
huge ferry-boats, crossed over to the curing-houses.
Now and then a fishing-boat sailed slowly in.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>One sees little from the cars. Of the country
through which we passed I remember only occasional
glimpses of the sea and of fishing villages
and of red castles, which made us wish we were
still on the road. Now and then, as we sat comfortably
in the railway-carriage, we determined to
walk back to see them, or to get a tricycle at Edinburgh
and "do" the whole east coast over again;
but we always left our determinations with the
carriage. Of all the places at which we stopped,
I remember best</p>


<h3>ARBROATH,</h3>

<p>the sight of which seemed worth his whole journey
to Dr. Johnson. Little is left of the abbey
save the broken walls and towers. A street runs
through the old gate-house. The public park and
children's play-ground lie to one side of the ruined
church. A few old tombs and tablets and bits of
ornament have been gathered together in the sacristy,
which is in better preservation than the rest
of the building. We found them less interesting
than the guide who explained them. He gave a
poetical touch to the usual verger recitation, and
indeed to all his talk, of which there was plenty.
'Twas better to have loved and lost, than never to
have loved at all, was his manner of expressing
regret for the loss of an old engraving of the abbey.
There were many hard things in this world,
but grass was soft; why, then, should I choose the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
hard things? was his way of inviting me to walk
on the grass instead of the gravel. But it was
not until he showed us the original copy, full of
blots and corrections, of one of Burns's poems that
we found he too was a poet&mdash;a successful poet,
it seemed, for he had sold 14,000 copies of his
volume of poems&mdash;very few, he thought. If he
were a member of the London Society of Authors
he would know better. He had given the last
copy to William Morris, when the latter was in
the town. William Morris did not wear gaudy
clothes, not he. He looked like a sailor in his
blue flannel shirt, and there was a slit in his hat.
And when he returned to London he sent his
"Jason" to his fellow-poet in Arbroath.</p>

<p>As we were leaving, he told us how, one day,
two ladies had driven up to the abbey, looked at
nothing, but at once asked him to recite his "Abbey
Gate." He did so, and then, without a word,
they slipped a guinea into his hand, and there were
tears on their cheeks. He never knew who they
were. After this, we felt our tribute to be very
small; but he clasped our hands warmly at parting.
There was something out of the common in our
faces, he said.</p>

<p>We talked to no one else in Arbroath, except to
a pessimistic stationer. While we bought his paper
he grumbled because farmers could not sell
their cattle and corn. Some people said the coun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>try needed protection; "but, sir, what have we got
to protect?"</p>

<p>Of the rest of the journey to Edinburgh my
note-book says nothing, and little remains in my
memory. But I know that when we walked up
from the station to Waverley Bridge, and looked
to the gray precipice of houses of the Old Town,
we realized that our long wanderings had not
shown us anything so fine.</p>

<p>And now our journey was at an end. Like Dr.
Johnson's, it began and finished in Edinburgh,
but it resembled his in little else. From the start,
we continually took liberties with his route; we
often forgot that he was our guide. We went to
places he had never seen; we turned our backs
upon many through which he and Boswell had
travelled. But at least he had helped us to form
definite plans without weeks of hard map-study
which they otherwise must have cost us.</p>

<p>We had come back wiser in many ways. In
the first place, we had learned that for us walking
on a tour of this kind, or indeed of any kind, is a
mistake. Had we never cycled, perhaps we might
not have felt this so keenly. Our powers of endurance
are not, I think, below the average; but
the power to endure so many miles a day on foot
is very different from the capacity to enjoy them;
and if on such a trip one proposes, as we did, to
work, without pleasure in the exercise, how can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>one hope for good results? But for the two days'
coaching on the west coast, the necessary steaming
among the islands, our utter collapse on the
east coast, I am sure we never should have worked
at all. Day after day we were dispirited, disheartened,
and only happy when we were not walking.
We went to bed in the evening and got up in the
morning wearied and exhausted. The usual walking
tours of which one hears mean a day's climbing
in the mountains, or a day's tramp with bag or
knapsack sent before by train or stage. Under
these conditions we probably would not be the
first to give in. But to be as independent as if on
a tricycle, to have one's sketching traps when needed,
one must carry a knapsack one's self. J&mdash;&mdash;'s
weighed between twenty-five and thirty pounds;
mine, fifteen. Never before have I appreciated so
well the true significance of Christian's burden.
But even worse than this constant strain on our
shoulders was the monotony of our pace. Whether
the road was good or bad, level or hilly, there was
no change, no relief. In cycling, for one hard
day's work you know you will have two of pleasure.
As for short-cuts, they are, as a rule, out of
the question. One does not know the country
through which one is passing; it is the exception
to meet a native. After cycling more thousands
of miles than we have walked hundreds, we know
it to be not mere theorizing when we declare that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
no comparison between the two methods of travelling
is possible. One is just enough work to make
the pleasure greater; the other is all work.</p>

</div>
<p class="caption">RUINS AT ARBROATH.</p>

<p>Our experience has taught us to be sceptical
about the tramps of other days who saw Europe
afoot. We wonder if they told the whole story.
Of modern tramps, none has given such a delightful
record as has Mr. Stevenson of the walk he
took with a donkey through the Cevennes. And
yet, even with him, if you read between his lines,
or, for that matter, the lines themselves, you realize
that, charming as his story is for us, the reality
for him was wearisome, depressing, and often painful,
and that probably to it is to be referred much
of his after physical weakness. We have also had
a new light thrown upon the life of tramps at
home, who are so often supposed to have chosen
the better part. Theirs is as much a life of toil as
if they broke stones on the same roads over which
they journey. They are not to be envied, but
pitied. The next time one begs from you as he
passes, give him something out of your charity;
he deserves it.</p>

<p>However, many drawbacks as there were to our
walk, we do not regret it. In no other way could
we have come to know the country and the people
with the same friendly intimacy. For pure enjoyment,
it would be best to go over the greater part
of our route in a yacht. From it is to be seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
much beauty and little misery. The coast-line can
be followed, excursions made inland. But a yacht
is a luxury for the rich. Besides, on it one lives
one's own life, not that of the country one has
come to visit. On foot, with knapsacks on our
backs, we often passed for peddlers. Certainly we
were never mistaken to be tourists of means or
sportsmen. Therefore the people met us as equals
and talked to us freely.</p>

<p>We were able to correct the vague and false impressions
with which we had started. If we did
not master the geography of all Scotland, I think&mdash;at
least on the two coasts as far north as the Caledonian
Canal&mdash;we could now pass an examination
with credit. We learned that haggis and oatmeal
figure more extensively in books than on hotel tables;
the first we saw not at all, the second but
twice, and then it was not offered to us.</p>

<p>Above all, we learned the burden of Scotland,
whose Highlands have been laid waste, their people
brought to silence. But now the people themselves
have broken their long silence, and a cry
has gone up from them against their oppressors.
If by telling exactly what we saw we can in the
least strengthen that cry, we shall feel that our
journeying has not been in vain.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_B" id="Footnote_B" href="#FNanchor_B"><span class="label">[B]</span></a> Even while we revise this Preface more news comes
from the Island of Lewis. On Lady Matheson's estates rents
have been reduced 42 and 53 per cent., and arrears cancelled
84 and 91 per cent. This is from the <i>Times</i> of December
20th:
</p>
<blockquote><p>"<span class="smcap">Crofters' Rents.</span>&mdash;The Crofter Commission yesterday issued
their first decisions in relation to Lady Matheson's property in
the Island of Lewis, the centre of the land agitation last winter.
They have granted an average reduction of 42 per cent. on the
rental of 150 crofter tenants in the parish of Barvas, on the west
side of Lewis. The arrears of rent due, which was a striking feature
in Lewis, have been cancelled to the extent of 84 per cent. Of
a total of £2422, the Commissioners have cancelled £2043."</p></blockquote>
<p>
If there had not been injustice before, is it probable that
there would now be such wholesale reductions and cancellings?
We suppose it is <i>sentimentalism</i> to record these facts.

looked into the matter, and a friend, a Highlander who
knows the Highlands as well as if not better than any of our
critics, assures us there are red deer in these woods. So
much for that wild burst of criticism! But if this were not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>

that deer are not protected by law in the Highlands.

<p>Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/license">http://www.gutenberg.org/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
